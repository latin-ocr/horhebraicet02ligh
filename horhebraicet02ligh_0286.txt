the winter, by the mildness of the weather, if they were not
gathered or shaken off by the wind: nay, they ripened in
winter. Hence came those cautions about tithing: “ Then
tree which puts forth its fruit before the beginning of the
year of the world'' [that is, before the beginning of the
month Tisri, in which mouth the world was created]‚ “ must
be tithed for the year past: but if after the beginning of
the world, then it must be tithed for the year coming on.
R. -J udan Bar Philia answered before R. Jonah, ‘ Behold the
tree Charob puts forth its fruit before the beginning of the
world, and yet it is *tithed for the year following’ R. J issa
saith, ‘ lf it puts forth a third part before the year of the
world, it must be tithed for the year past ; but if after, then
for the year following? R. Zeira answers before R. -Jissa
‘ Sometimes palm-trees do not bring forth part of their fruit
till after the beginning of the year of the world; and yet
they must be tithed for the year before.’ Samuel Bar Abba
saith, ³ If it puts0 forth the third part of its fruit before the
fifteenth day of the month Shebat, it is to be tithed for the
year past 3 if after the fifteenth day of the month Shebat,
for the year to come.’ '’ Hence that axiorn in Rosh Hasha·
nah, ‘⁴ The Ρ first day of the month Shebat is the beginning
of the year for trees, according to the school of Shammai3
but, according to that of llillel, the fifteenth day.⁷'

However, fig-trees were not among those trees that put-
forth their fruit after the beginning of Tisri3 for you have
seen before, out of the Tahnudists, that they used to put
forth their leaves in the month Nisan: and that their fruit
used to be ripe in thrice fifty days after this. Yet, perhaps,
it may be objected about them, what we meet wit-h in the
Jerusalem Gemara, at the place before cited: “ One gathers
figs (say they), and knows not at what time they were put
forth'’ (and thereby is at a loss sor what year to tithe them).
“ R. ‚Jonah saith, ‘ Let him reckon a hundred days back-
wards; and if the fifteenth day of the month Shebat falls
within that number, then he may know when they were put
forth.⁹ '² But this must be understood of figs of a particular
sort, which do not grow after the usual manner, which is
