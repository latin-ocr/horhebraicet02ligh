Christ answers the treachery of the question propounded,
out of the very determinatione of the schoolsss‚ where this
was taught, “ Wheresoever the money of any king is current,
there the inhabitants acknowledge that king for their lord.''
Hence is that of the Jerusalem Sankedrin0 2 “Abigail said to
David, ‘What evil have I done, or my sons⁷ or my cattle 3'
He answered, ‘Your husband vilifies my kingdom.’ ‘ Are you
then,' said she, ‘ a king 3' To which he, ‘Did not Samuel anoint
me for a king?= She replied, thim] ΪἾὮἻ mmmm ΓἾἾΞ)

not be proved out of the law. I told them, You corrupt your
