So Kimchi also upon the place; “The word ἾῬἾ-ξζ (saith
he) means this; That his sons shall die in his life, if lie shall
now have sons: but if he shall not now have sonS‚ he never
shall. But our Rabbins of blessed memory say, That he
repented in prison. And they say moreover, Oh ! how much
doth repentance avail, which evacuates a penal edict! for It
is said, ‘ VVrite ye this man childless:' but, he repenting Χ,
this edict turned to his good,” &a ‘⁶ R. J ochanan saith, His
carrying away expiated. For when it is said, ‘Write this
man childless,' after the carrying away it is said, ‘The sons
