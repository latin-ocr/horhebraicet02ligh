does always represent as well the saints as the wicked stand-
ing before the tribunal of Christ, Matt. xxv. 32, 2 Cor. v. 10,
διο. ; we have mention here only of “ twelve thrones.'’ And,
2, we have mention only of judging the “ twelve tribes of
Israel.” The sense, therefore, of the place may very well be
found out by weighing these things following:

Ι. That those thrones set up in Daniel are not to be
understood of the last judgment of Christ, but of his judg-
ment in his entrance upon his evangelical government, when
he was made by his Father chief ruler, king, and judge of
all things: Psalm ii. 6, Matt. xxviii. 18, John v. 27. For
observe the scope and series of the prophet, that, after the
four monamhies, namely, the Babyloniam, the Medo-Persian,
the Gmcian, and the Syro-Grecian, which monarchies had
vexed the world and the church by their tyranny, were de·
stroyed, the kingdom of Christ should rise, &c. Those
words, ‘⁶ The kingdom of heaven is at hand,'’ that judiciary
scene set up Rev. iv. and v., and those thrones Rev. xx. 1, &a
do interpret Daniel to this sense.

II. The throne of glory, concerning which the words before
us are, is to be understood of the judgment of Christ to be
brought upon the treacherous, rebellious‚ wicked, J ewish
people. We meet with very frequent mention of the coming
of Christ in his glory in this sense ; which we shall discourse
more largely of at chap. xxiv.

ΙΙΙ. That the sitting of the apostles upon thrones with
Christ is not to be understood of their persons, it is suffi-
ciently proved; because J udas was now one of the number:
but it is meant of their doctrine .· as if he had said, “ When I
shall bring judgment upon this most unjust nation‚ then your
doctrine, which you have preached in my name, shall judge
and condemn them.'' See Rom. ii. 16.

Hence it appears that the gospel was preached to all the
twelve tribes of Israel before the destruction of Jerusalem.
