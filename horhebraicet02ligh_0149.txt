But that we be not too tedious, even from this very opinion,
they were wont to betake themselves to the synagogues, be-
cause they were persuaded that the prayers of the synagogue
were oertainly heard.

III. They prayed in the streets. So Maimonides; “ Theyy
’ prayed in the streets on the feasts and publio fasts.” “ Whatz
are the rites of the fasts ἓ They brought out the ark into the
streets of ‘she city, and sprinkled ashes upon the ark, and upon
the head of the president of the Sanhedrim‚ and the vice-pre-

“ Hatha not a man prayed his morning prayers‘? When he
goes into the synagogue, does he find them praying the addi-
tionary prayer? If he is sure he shall begin and end, so that
he may answer ‘ Amen' after the angel of the church, let him
say his prayers.”
