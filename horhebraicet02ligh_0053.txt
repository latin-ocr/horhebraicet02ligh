also, ‘Not for your sake, Ο Israel, do I this) And again,
‘ I will remember for them my old covenant,' 850. And these
places, 011 1116 other hand, make for repentance : ‘ Thou shalt
return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice?
And again 3 ‘ And thence thou shalt seek the Lord thy God,
and shalt find him, if thou seekest him with all thy heart,'
&c. But these may be reconciled after this mannen namely.
that many of Israel shall repent, when they shall see the
signs of redemption. And hence is that which is said, ⁶ And
he saw 11131 there was no man,' because they will not repent
until they see the beginning of redempti0n.’'

“If IsraelS shall repent but one day, forthwith the Redeemer
cometh.”

Therefore, it is very fitly argued by the Baptist, and by
our Saviour after him, Mat-t. iv. 17, from the approach of the
kingdom of heaven to repentance‚ since they themselves to
whom this is preached do acknowledge that thus the king-
dom of heaven, or the manifestation of the Messias, is to be
brought 111. For however the Gemarists who dispute of this
were of a later age, yet for the most part they do but speak
the sense of their fathers.

[ΙΙ. Τ116 word μετάνοια, repentance, as it does very well
express the sense of true repentance, so among the Jews it
was necessaryt that it should be so expressed, among whom
repentance, for the most part, was thought to consist in the
confession of the mouth only. '

“ WhosoeverU, 0111 of error 01· presumption‚ shall transgress
the precepts of the law, whether they be those that command
01· those that forbid, when he repents and returns from his
sins, he is bound to make confession. VVhosoever brings an
offering for a sin, committed either out of ignorance or pre-
sumption, his sin is not expiated by the offering‚ until he
makes an oral confession. Or whosoever is guilty of death,
or of scourging by the Sanhedrim, his sin is not taken away
by his death, or by his scourging, if he do not repent and
make confession. And because the scape—goat is the expiation
for all Israel, therefore the high priest makes confession over
him sor all Israel.”
