and a burnt-offering of birds. He stands by the sacrifice for
transgression, and lays both his hands upon 11, and slays it :
and two priests receive the blood3 the one in a 1166661, 1116
011161 in his hand. He who receives the blood in his hand
goes to the leper in the chamber of the lepers :'' this was in
