Oh. x. 1.] Exercitations upon St. Mark. 427

Πᾶσα θυσία, every sacrifice, saith our Saviour‚ concerning
holy men seasoned with grace: so the prophet, “ They shall
bring your brethren for a gift to the Lord, as the children of
Israel do the sacrifices.”'

ξΑλισθήσουται. πυρὶ, shall be seasoned with, fire, saith our
Saviour of wicked men: in the same sense Isaiah, “ They
shall be in unquenchablek fire, and yet their worm shall not
die.”

Their fire and their worm ε whose? Concerning the former,

the true time and method of this story, and of Ohrist's journey.

mediately before-going, and this travel of our Saviour3 how-
ever it seems to be intimated by our evangelist, and likewise
by MattheW, that when he had finished those worda forth-
with he entered upon his journey: when, in truth, he went
before to Jerusalem, through the midst of Samaria, to the
feast of Tabernacles, Luke ix. 51, &c. John vii. And again,
from Galilee, after he had returned thither, through the cities
and towns to Jerusalem, Luke xiii. 22 3 to the feast of Dedi-
cation, John x. 22 : and againl, “ beyond J ordan⁵' indeed, John
X. 403 but first taking his way into Galilee, and thence be-
yond Jordan, according to that story which is before us. The
studious reader, and that in good earnest employeth his
labour upon this business, has no need of further proof ς 1118
own eyes will witness this sufficiently. Thus, the wisdom and
spirit of God directed the pens of these holy writers, that
