the name of the Pasckal lamb, and to be killed ἹἾἿἾΠὩῙὩ fin· the
company mentioned. See what the Gemarists say of this thing
in Pesaolzink : “ If they kill it for such as are not to eat, or
as are not numbered, for such as are not circumcised or
unclean, it is profane: if for those that are to eat, and not to
eat, numbered and not numbered, for circumcised and not
circumcised, clean and unclean, it is right:” that is, for
those that are numbered, that atonement may be made for
the not numbered 3 for the circumcised, that atonement may

the Glosses.

“ that lying,'' as the Gloss on the place saith, “ was when
they leaned on their left side upon couches, and ate and
drank as they thus leaned.'' And the same Gloss in another
