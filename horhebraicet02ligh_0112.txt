various readings do so frequently occur. Concerning this
business we will offer these few things only, that so we may

I do much suspect that these three books laid up in the
court answered to the threefold congregation of the Jews,
namely, in J udea, Babylon, and Egypt, whence these copies
might be particularly taken. For, however that nation was
scattered abroad almost throughout the whole world, yet, by
number and companies scarcely to be numbered, it more
plentifully increased in these three countries than any where
else: in Judea, by those that returned from Babylon; in
Babylon, by those that returned not3 and in Egypt, by the
temple of Onias. The two copies that agreed, Ι judge to be
out of Judea and Babylon3 that that differed to be out of
Egypt : and this last Ι suspect by this, that the word *mwmy'c
Zaatuti smells of the Seventy interpreters, whom the Jews of
Egypt might be judged, for the very sake of the place, to
favour more than any elsewhere. Fork it is asserted by the
J ewish writers, that· 'mium was one of those changes which
