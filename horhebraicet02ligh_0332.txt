fines, but that it did not judge in capital causes? And the
reason was this, ”¹7:³¹⁸ 8191 vrrs-m ars& *wrm-r nri-r w:
37³2ss because they saw murderers so much increase that they
could not flod-qe them. They said therefore, ⁶ It is fit that we
should remove from place to place, that so we may avoid the
guilt.'⁷' That is, the number and boldness of thieves and
murder-ers growing so great that, by reason thereos, the au-
thority of the council grew weak, and neither could nor dared
put them to death. “ It is better (say they) for us to re-
move from hence, out of this chamber Gazith, where, by the
quality of the place, we are obliged to judge them, than that, by
by sitting still here, and not judging them, we should render
ourselves guilty.” Hence it is that neither in the highest
nor in the inferior councils any one was punished with death.
(“ For they did not judge of capital matters in the inferior
0011110118 111 any city, but only when the great council sat in
the chamber Gazitl1,” saith the Gloss.) The authority of
them was not taken away by the Romans, but rather relin-
quished by themselves. The slothfulness of the council de-
stroyed its own authority. Hear it justlyt upbraided in this
matter u : “ The eouncil which puts but one to death in seven
years is called Destructive. R. Lazar Ben Azariah said,
‘thich puts one to death in seventy years? R. Tarphon
and R. Akiba said, ·' If we had been in the couneil' (when it
judged of capital matters), ‘ there had 110110 ever been put to
death by it? R. Simeon ssen Gamaliel said, ‘ These men
have increased the number of murderers in Israe].”' Most
certainly true, O Simeon! for by this means the power of
the council came to be weakened in capital matters, because
they, either by mere slothfulness, or by a foolish tenderness,
or, as indeed the truth was, by a most fond estimation of an
Israelite as an Israelite, they so far neglected to punish blood·
shed and murder, and other crimes, till wickedness grew so
untractable that the authority of the council trembled for
fear of it, and dared not kill the killers. In this sense their
saying must be understood, It is not Zawful for us to put any
man to death: their authority of judging not being taken
from them by the Romans, but lost by themselves, and de-
spised by their people.
