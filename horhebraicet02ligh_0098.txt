apostle, 1 Tim. iii. 13, “They that have performed the office of
a deaeon well have obtained to themselves a good degree :”
that is, being faithful in their care and provision for the
poor, as to their oorporal life, they may well be probationem
for the care of souls. For when those Parnasia, as also all
the ten, were learned and studious, they might with good
reason be preferred from the care of bodies to that of souls.
The apostles’ deacons are to be reekoned also of the same
learned and studious rank. And now let us turn our eyes
a little from the synagogues to Christian ohurohes, in the
history of the New Testament. When the Romans permitted
the Jewish synagogues to nse their own laws and proper
government, why, Ι pray, should there not be the same to-
leration allowed to the apostolioal ohurohes? The Romanl
censure had as yet made no difference between the J udaizing
synagogues of the Jews, and the Christian synagogues or
ohurehes of Jews; nor did it permit them to live after their ·
own laws, and forbid these. I am not, therefore, afraid to
assert, that the ehurohes of that first age were wanting to
themselves, if they took not up the same liberty of govern—
ment as the Romans allowed the J ewish synagogues to use.
And Ι (10 not think that was said by the apostle, 1 Cor. vi.
2, 3, &o. without this foundation. Therefore, this power of
their own government being allowed them, if so be they were
minded to enjoy what they might, how easily may those words
of the apostle be understood, which have so raeked learned
men (shall I say 2²), or which have been so raoked by them,

4. We may reokon the eighth man of these ten to be the
ἶὩλἾἿΠ, that is, the interpreter in the synagogue; who, being
skilled in the tongues, and standing by him that read in the
laW, rendered in the mother-tongue, verse by verse, those
things that were read out of the Hebrew text. The duty of
this interpreter, and the rules of his duty, you may read at
large in the Talmudn.
