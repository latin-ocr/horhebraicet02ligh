testimony is vain, as R. Meir saith. But saith R. J udah, their
testimony consists together. But if one saith, the fifth hour,
another, the seveuth hour, their testimony is vain; because
in the fifth hour the sun is in the east part of heaven 3 in the
seventh‚ in the west part.'' They dispute largely concerning
this matter in the place alleged, and concerning evidences dif-
fering in words3 nevertheless‚ as to the thing itself, they con-
clude that both may be true, because witnesses may be de-
ceived in the computation of hours: which to conclude con-
cerning the evangelists, were impious and blasphemetis. But
there is one supposes the copiers were deceived in their trans-
scription, and would have the computation of John corrected
into ἢν δὲ ὥρα ὡσεὶ τρίτη, and it was about tlte third tour: too
boldly, and indeed without any reason, for it is neither cre-
dible norz possible indeed, that those things which went be-
fore our Saviour's crucifixion should be done *mv ΠῙῬΠΞ

first kours of tlte day. The harmony therefore of the evange-
lists is to be fetched elsewhere.

Ι. Let us repeat that out of Maimonides; “The great
Sanhedrim sat from the morning daily sacrifice, until the
asternoon daily sacrifice.'' But now when the morning daily
sacrifice was at the third hour, the Sanhedrim sat not before
that hour. Take heed, therefore, thou that wouldest have
the words of John, “and it was about the siaetlt hour‚” to be
changed into, ‘⁶ and it was about the third hour‚” lest thou
becomest guilty of a great solecism. For Pilate could not
deliver Christ to be crucified about the third hour, when the
Sanhedrim sat not before the third hour, and Christ was not
yet delivered to Pilate.

But you will say, the words of Mark do obscure these
things much more. For if the Sanhedrim that delivered up
Christ met not together before the third honr, one can no way
say that they crucified him the third hour.

We do here propound two things for the explanation of
this matter.

Let the first be taken from t-he day itself, and froin the
