and cateth his common food in cleanness‚ and speaks the
holy language, and recites his phylacteries morning and
evening, let him be confident that he shall obtain the life of
the world to come.”

ΙΙΙ. Here that distinction is to be observed between

ΠἸἾὊΝ ΠἾΒΞΝῩΞ forbidden meats, and ΓΝῺΎΔ fimi& umalama
mactis. Of both Maimonides wrote a proper tract. For-

bidden meats, such as fat, blood, creatures unlawful to be
caten (Levit. ii.), were by no means to be caten: but means,
uncleom in themselves, were lawful indeed to be caten, but
contracted some uncleanness elsewhere: it was lawful to eat
them, and it was not lawful ; or, to speak as the thing indeed
is, they might eat them by the law of God, but by the canons
of Pharisaism they might not.

IV. The distinction also between &Dm unclean, and ‘7505
profane or pollcctecl, is to be observed. Rambam, in his pre-
sace to Toharotk, declares it.

ἸΠῙἋῗ &ew &⁷7oe ³:³39 ³7³0? Profaaze or polluted denotas ι
this, that it cloes not pollute another beside itseff. For every
thing which uncleanness invades so that it becomes unclean,
but renders not another thing unclean‚ is called &UOD pro-
fane. And hence it is said of every one thatt eats unclean
meat& or drinks unclean drinks‚ ἿΠἾἾἸᾸ 17me that his body
is pollulecl .· but he pollutes not another. Note that, “the
body of the eater is polluted by unclean meats.” To which
you may add that which follows in the same Maimonides, in
the place before alleged: “ Separation from the common
people, Sao„ conduces to the purity of the body from evil
works3 the purity of the body conduceth to the sanctity of
the soul from cvil affections; the sanctity os the soul con-
duces unto likeness to God, as it is said, ‘ And ye shall be
sanctified, and ye shall bc holy, because Ι, the Lord that
sanctify you, ain holy.''' Hence you may more clearly per-
ceive the force of Christ’s confutation‚ which we have ver.
17—20.

V. They thought that clean food was polluted by unclean
hands, and that the hands were polluted by unclean meats.
You would wonder at this tradition z ‘⁶ Uncleanu meats and
