the sister of Lazarus was not present at the crucifixion of
Christ, and at his burial, or else she is passed over in silence
by the evangelists ; both which are improbable. Whence she
was called flffaydalena doth not so plainly appear3 whether
from Ilsagydala, a town on the lake of Gennesaret, or from the
word &bl-1⁵22 which signifies a plaitz'nq or curliwy os the kair,
a thing usual with harlots. Let us see what is spoken by the
Talmudists concerning ΝῘΤῙᾸΤΞ ΞἾἽῺ Mary Maydala, who,
they say, was mother of Ben Satday:

“ They stoned the son of Satda in Lydda, and they hanged
him up on the evening of the Passover. Now this son of
Satda was son of Pandira. Indeed, Rabh Chasda said,
‘ The husband [of lais mother] was Satda ; her husband was
Pandira 3 her husband was Papus the son of Juda: but yet
Ι say his mother was Satda, ww: &³713OE ΞἾἾῩΞ namely,
Mary, the plaiter of women's Ιιαὶνς as they say in Pombeditha,
mlvynn &7 nmo she departed from her husband? '⁹ These
words are also repeated in Sohabbatkz: “ Rabh Bibai, at a
time when the angel of death was with him, said to his officer‚
Go, ΝἿἾΠΞ ἾΞΝΒ &³700 &³572 *³7 'I'W‘N bring] me IlIary the
plaiter of women’s kair. He went and brought to him ΞἾἾὩ
”sp-157 ζὴῘΤγλῃ Illary, the pleniter of young] ‘men's hair-‚³³ διο.
The a Gloss ; “ The angel of death reckoned up to him what
he had done before: for this story of lisam, the plaiter qf
women's hair, was under the second Temple, for she was the
mother of N„ as it is said in Schabbatlc.” See the Gloss there
at the place before quoted.

“ Thereb are some who find a fiy in their cup, and take it
out and will not drink3 such was Papus Ben Judas‚ who
locked the door upon his wife, and went out.'' Where the
Glosser says thus ; ‘⁴ Papus Ben J uda was the husband
&mm &³772n 0³57: of M ary, the pleniter qs women’s hair ; and
when he went out of his house into the street, he locked his
door upon his wife, that she might not speak with anybody;
which, indeed, he ought not to have done ε and hence sprang
a difference between them, and she broke out into adulteries.’'
