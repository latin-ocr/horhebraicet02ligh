Lord'’ (for the goat that was to be offered up on the day of
Expiation) “ came out on the left hand. And the gates of
the Temple, which were shut over night, were found open in
the morning. Rabban Joehanan Ben Zaecai said, ⁴ There-
fore, Ο Temple, wherefore dost thou trouble us? we know
thy fate3 namely, that thou art to be destroyed : for it is said.
Open, Ο Lebanon Ρ, thy gateS, that· the flame may consume
thy cedars.’ '² ‘⁶ A tradition c1. F orty years before the
Temple was destroyed, judgment in capital causes was taken
away from Israel.” “ F 01‘ty¹' years before the Temple was
destroyed, the council removed and sat in the sheds.''

W ith these two last traditions lies our present business.
What the Jews said, John xviii. 31, ‘Huiv οὐκ ἔξεστιν ἀπο-
κτεῖναι οὐδένα· It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,
signifies the same thing with the tradition before us, ⁴⁶ J udg-

were they first taken away? “ Forty years before the de-
struction of the Telnple,” say the Talmudists: no doubt
before the death of Christ; the words of the Jews imply so
much. But how were they taken away? It is generally re-
ceived by all that the Romans did so far divest the counoil
of its authority, that it was not allowed by them to punish
any with death3 and this is gathered from those words of the
Jews, “ It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.''

But if this, indeed, be true, 1. What do then those words
of our Saviour mean S, παραδώσουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς συνέδρια, they
will deliver you up to the counoils ,9 2. How did they put
Stephen to death? 3. Why was Paul so much afraid to
commit himself to the council, that he chose rather to appeal
to Oaesar ?

The Talmudists excellently well clear the matter: “ What
signifieth that tradition (say they) of the removal of the
council forty years before the ruin of the Temple? Rabh
Isaac Bar Abdimi saith, ‘It signifieth thus much, that they
did not judge of fines.'” And a little asten ‘⁶ But R. Nach-
man Bar Isaac saith, ‘ Do not say that it did not judge of
