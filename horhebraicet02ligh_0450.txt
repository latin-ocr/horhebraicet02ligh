444 Hebrew and Talmudioal [Oh. xiii. 32.

very often: as in that passage, John V. 19, “The Son,'' that
is, the Messias, “ can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth
the Father do :'' ver. 20, “ The Father loveth the Messias,’'
&c.: ver. 26, “ He hath given to the Messias to have life in
himself‚'' &a And that the word Son is to be rendered in
this sense, appears from ver. 273 “ He hath given him au-
thority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of
man.'' Observe that, “ because he is the Son of man.''

Ι. It is one thing to understand “ the Son of God³⁵ barely
and abstractly for the second person in the Holy Trinity;
another to understand him for the Messias, or that second
person incarnate. To say that the second person in the
Trinity knows not something is blasphemous3 to say so of
the Messias, is not so, who, nevertheless, was the same with
the second person in the Trinity: for although the second
person, abstractly considered according to his mere Deity,
was co-equal with the Father, co-omnipotent, co-omniscient,
co-eternal with him, &c. 3 yet Messias, who was God·man,
considered as Messias, was a servant and a messenger of the
Father, and received commands and authority from the
Father. And those expressions, ‘⁶ The Son can do nothing
of himself,” &a will not in the least serve the Arian’s turn,
if you take them in this sense, which you must necessarily do,
“Messias can do nothing of himself, because he is a servant
and a deputy.’'

ΙΙ. W e must distinguish between the excellences and per-
fections of Christ, which flowed from the hypostatical union
of the natureS, and those which flowed from the donation and
anointing of the Holy Spirit. From the hypostatical union
of the natures flowed the infinite dignity of his person, his
impeccability, his infinitef self-sufficiency to perform the law,
and to satisfy the divine justice. From the anointing of the
Spirit flowed his power of miracles, his foreknowledge of
things to come, and all kind of knowledge of evangelie mys-
teries. Those rendered him a fit and perfect Redeemer3 these
a fit and perfect Minister of the gospel.

Now, therefore, the foreknowledge of things to come, of
which the discourse here is, is to be numbered among those
