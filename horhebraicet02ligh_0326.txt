And then shall appear tlce siqu of tlte Son of mam] Then shall
the Son of mom give a proof of himself, whom they would not
before acknowledge: a proof, indeed, not in any visible figure,
but in vengeance and judgment so visible, that all the tribes
of the earth shall be forced to acknowledge him the avenger.
The Jews would not know him: now they shall know him,

foregoing verses are not to be understood of the last judg-
