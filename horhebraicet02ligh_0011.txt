DEDIOATION. 5

ΙΙΙ. To note those things which referred to the history of
the Jews, whether ecclesiastical, or scholastic, or civil; or
which referred to the Christian history, or the history of the
rest of the world.

And nour, after having viewed and observed the nature, art,
matter, and marrow of these authors with as much intention
as we could, I cannot paint out, in little, a true and lively
character of them better than in these paradoxes and riddles :
There are no authors do more affright and vex the reader3
and yet there are none who do more entice and delight him.
In no writers is greater or equal trifling ; and yet in none is
greater or so great benefit. The doctrine of the gospel hath
no more bitter enemies than they; and yet the text of the
gospel hath no more plain interpreter-s. To say all in a
word, to the Jews, their countrymen, they recommend nothing
but toys, and destruction, and poison3 but Christians, by
their skill and industry, may render them most usefully ser-
viceable to their studies, and most eminently tending to the
interpretation of the New Testament.

We here offer some specimen of this our reading and our
choice, for the reader’s sake, if so it may find acceptance with
the reader. YVe know how exposed to suspicion it is to prc-
duce new things 3 how exposed to hatred the Talmudic writings
are 3 how exposed to both, and to sharp censure also, to pro-
duce ·them in holy things. Therefore, this our more unusual
manner of explaining Scripture cannot, upon that very ac-
count= but look for a more unusual censure, and become sub-
ject to a severer examination. But when the lot is cast, it
is too late at this time to desire ‘co avoid the sequel of it;
and too much in vain in this place to attempt a defence.
If the work and book itself does not carry something with it
which may plead its cause, and obtain the reader's pardon
and favour; our oration, or begging Epistle, will little avail
to do it. The present work, therefore, is to be exposed and
delivered over to its fate and fortune, whatsoever it be. Some
there are, we hope, who will give it a milder and more gentle
reception ς for this very thing, dealing favourably and kindly
with us, that we have been intent upon our studies3 that we have
been intent upon the gospe13 and that we have endeavoured
after truth: they will show us favour that we followed after
