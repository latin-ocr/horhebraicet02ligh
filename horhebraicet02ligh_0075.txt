charms tinkling in a pan3 and, takingd off the cover, the
charms presently came out, and strait the infant is born3 and
hence it was known that she was a witch.”

I have therefore cited these passages, not only that it may
be shown that there were women-Pharisees, and so that the
name is not taken from interpretz'ny or eoepoundiny, but that
it may be observed also what kind of women, for the most
part, embrace Pharisaisnu namely‚ widows and maids, under
the veil of sanctity and devotion, hiding· and practising all
manner of wickedness. And so much we gain of the history
of the Pharisaes, while we are tracing the etymology of the
word.

II. That the Pharisees therefore were so called from the
word ΨἾΞ, signifying separation, is more commonly asserted,
and more truly; and the thing itseff, as well as the word,
speaks it. So that by a word more known to us, you might
rightly call the phariseos, Separatists ; but in what sense, has
need of more narrow inquiry. The differences of the J ewish
people are to be disposed here into divers ranks: and, first,
we will begin with the women.

1. It were an infinite task to search particularly, how their
canons inclulyed (shall I say ἓ) or prescribed the woman a free-
dom from very many rites, in which a great part of the J ew-
ish religion was placed. How numberless are the times that
that occurs in the Talmudic pandect, ΞἿΣΠΔΡἹ ΓἾΞὩἾ D‘w]
ΓἾἾΕΞ “ W omene, servants, <ind children, are not bound to these
thinys. Womenf, servants, and children, are not bound to
recite their phylactories, nor to wear them. cmv] ³712> ῙΠῠΞ
miv-i The Passovers of women are at their own will.” And,
not to dwell upon things that are obvious, let this one serve
instead of many : “Ag certain matron asked R. Eleazar,Why‚
when Aaron sinned in making the golden calf, the people are
punished with a threefold death? He answered‚ Let not a
woman be learned beyond her distaff. Hircanus his son said
unto him, Because no answer is given her in one word out of
the law, she will withdraw from us three hundred tenth cori
yearly. To whom he replied‚ Let them rather go and be
burnt‚ than the words of the law be delivered to women.'’
