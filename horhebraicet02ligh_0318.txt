Ver. 9: Τότε παραδώσουσιν ὑμᾶς εἰς θλίψιν· Thon shall these]
deliver you up Co be afflictent] To this relate those words of
Peter, 1 Ep. iv. 17, ‘⁶ The time is come that judgment must
begin at the house of God 3⁹² that is, the time foretold by our
Saviour is now at hand, in which we are to be delivered up to
persecution, 820. These words denote that perseoution which
the Jews, now near their ruin, stirred up almost everywhere
against the professors of the gospel. They had indeed op-
pressed them hitherto on all sides, as far as they could, with
slanders, rapines, whippings, stripes‚ διο. which these and
such like places testify3 1 Thess. ii. 14, ¹5 ς Heb. x. 33, &a
But there was something that put a rub in their way, that,
as yet, they could not proceed to the utmost cruelty; “ Andm
now ye know what withholdeth;” which, I suppose, is to be
understood of Claudius enraged at and curbing in the

his first five years, suffering all things to be turned topsy

This is called by Peter⁰ (who himself also at last suffered in
it) πύρωσις πρὸς πειρασμὸν, α fierjt] 15νὶαῶ by Christi), dio-
tating the epistles to the seven churches θλίψις ἡμερῶυ δέκα,

σθαι ἐπὶ τῆς οἰκουμένης ὅλης, tlmq Ιιοιιν of templatim, which. shall
come upon all tlte world of Christians. And this is ‘⁶ the reve-
lation of that wicked one’' St. Paulr speaks of, now in lively,
that is, in bloody colonrs, openly declaring himself Antichrist,
the enemy of Christ. In that persecution J ames suffered at
Jerusalem, Peter in Babylon, and Antipas at Pergamus, and
others, as it is probable, in not a few other places Hence,
