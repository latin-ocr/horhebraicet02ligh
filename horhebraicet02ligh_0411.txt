Oh. iii. 21 .] Exercitatioozs upon St. Mark. 405

1 Pet. v. 1 : but I ask, whether any of the twelvc, besides this
our apostle (his brother James being now dead), could be
known to those that were absent under this title, the elder,
by a proper, not additional name, as he is in his two latter
Epistles.

Ver. 21: “On ἐξέστη· He is beside himself] In the Tal-

'my'l mmm and yet is of a sound mind, and they say to
him, Shall we write a bill of divorce for thy wife? and he nods
with his head, they try him thrice, &a And it is necessary

How fitly this word ἐξέστη expresseth these phrases is
readily observed by him who understandeth both languages.
And a JeW, reading these words in Mark, would presently
have recourse to the sense of those phrases in his nation;
which do not always signify madmss, or being bereft of one’s
wits, in the proper sense, but sometimes, and very frequently,
some discomposure of the understanding for the present, from
some too vehement passion. So say Christ⁷s friends, ΠΞἾζο]

sels, and his own health3 he is so vehement and hot in dis-
