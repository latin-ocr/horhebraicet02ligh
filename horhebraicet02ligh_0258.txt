VER. 1: Τίς ἄρα μείζων ἐστὶν ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τῶν οὗρανῶυ;
ΠῘΙιο 2⁸3 tlae yreatest in the lcinydom of heaven ?] It cannot be
passed over without observation, that the ambitious dispute
of the disciples coneerning primacy, for the most part fol-
lowed the mention of the death of Christ and his resurrec-
tion. See this story in Mark ix. 31—33, and Luke ix.
44—46: ‘⁶' He said to his diseiples, Lay up these discourses

the death of Christ, when together with that they saw his rem
surrection : for then they also asked, “ Wilt thou at this time
restore the kingdom to Israel 3³³ Acts i. 6.

However, after Christ had ostentimes foretold his death
and resurrection, it always follows in the evangelists that
“ they understood not what was spoken ;'' yet the opinion
