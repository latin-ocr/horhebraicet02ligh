CHAP. VI.u

VER. 3 ε Οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Tim-mm Is not this the carpenter .9
Among other things to be performed by the father for his
son this was one, to bring him up in some art or trade.
‘⁴ Itx is incumbent on the father to circumcise his son, to
redeem him, to teach him the laW, and to teach him some
occupatiori. R. J udah saith, ‘Whosoever teacheth not his
son to do some work, is as if he taught him robbery.'”
“R. Meiry saith, ⁴ Let a man always endeavour to teach his
son Ππῆρῃ ,ΠῺὮἾΝ cm honest art,' '² διο. J oseph instructs and
brings up Christ in his carpenter’s trade.

Ver. 8: Μὴ πήραν· Nor semp] Concerning the scrip
we said somewhat at Matt. X. 10: let us add this story:
‘⁶ TheZ Rabbins deliver: There is a story of a certain man,
whose sons behaved not themselves well. He stood forth
and assigned over his wealth to J onathan Ben Uzziel. What
did Jonathan Ben Uzziel do? He sold a third part3 a third
part he dedicated to holy uses; and a third part he gave
back to the sons of the deceased. Shammai came to him
ἾΚῬἿΌἾΠἸ ’1517731 with his staff and with his scrip.” The
Gloss saith, “He came to contend with Jonathan‚ because
he had violated the will of the dead.'’ Behold the vice-presi-
dent of the Sanhedrim carrying a scrip, in which he laid up
victuals for his journey.

Ver. 13: '‘HAeccpov ἐλαίῳ πολλοὺς ἀρρώστους· Anointed 'with
oil many that were sich] “ The oil, therefore, was (saith the
famous Beza) a symbol of that miraculous power, not a me-
dicament whereby they cured diseases.’' But the Jews say,
and that truly, such an anointiny was physical, although it
did not always obtain its end. But this anointiny of the apo-
stles ever obtained its end: ‘⁶ R. Simeon a Ben Eliezer saith,
‘ R. Meir permitted the mingling of wine and oil, and to
anoint the sick on the sabbath. But when he once was sick,
and we would do the same to him, he permit-ted it not.'''
This story is recited elsewhere, Schab. s. ¹4· 33 where sor
‘ R. Simeon Ben Eliezer‚' is ‘ R. Samuel Ben Eliezer.' Per-
