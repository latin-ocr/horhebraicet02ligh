clean, and change your garments,” &a Gen. xxxv. 2. What
that word means, ἾἾζῖἶρΠἸ and be pse oleam, Aben Ezra does

very well interpret to be ἢἸλΠ 'lm-ww> the washiny of the.
body, or baptism ,· which reason itself also persuades us to
believe.

II. All the nation of Israel do assert, as it were with one
mouth, that all the nation of Israel were brought into the
covenant, among other things, by baptism. “ Israel (saith
Maimonidest‚ the great interpreter of the J ewish law) was
admitted into the covenant by three things,—namely, by cir-
cumcision, baptism, and sacrifice. Circumcision was in Egypt ;
as it is said, ‘ None uncircumcised shall eat of the passover.'
Baptism was in the wilderness before the giving of the law3
as it is said, ‘Thou shalt sanetify them to- day and to- -morrOW,
and let them wash their garments?

III. They assert‚ that that infinite number of proselytes 111
the day of David and Solomon were admittedu by baptism:
“TheX Sanhedrims received not proselytes in the days of
David and Solomon: not in the days of David, lest they
should betake themselves to proselytism out of a fear of the
kingdom of Israel: not in the days of Solomon, lest they
might do the same by reason of the glory of the kingdom.
And yet abundance of proselytes were made in the days of
David and Solonion before private men 3 and the great San-
hedrim was full of care about this business: for they would
not cast them out of the church, because they were bap·
tized,’' &c.

IV. “ Whensoevery any heathen will betake himself, and
be joined to the covenant of Israel, and place himself under
the wings of the divine Majesty‚ and take the yoke of the
law upon him, voluntary circumcision, baptism, and obla-
tion‚ are required: but if it be a woman, baptism and obla-
tion.''

It is disputed by the Babylonian Gemara2, “A proselyte, that
