pulling off of the shoe [of the husband's brother, Deut. xxv. 9]
is right: and of the sandal, if it hath a heel, is right; but if
not, it is not right?

ᾗ( R. Josir saith, Ι went to Nisibin, and I saw there a
certain elder, and I said to him, ‘ Are you well acquainted
with R. J udah Ben Betira ζ’ And he answered‚ ‘ I am a money
changer in my city3 and he came to my table very often?
I said, ‘Did you ever see him putting off the sleoe? What
did he put off, skoe or sundal ,θ’ He answered, ‘ Ο Rabbi, are
there sanclals among usss' &Vhence therefore, say Ι, did R.
Meir say, ‘7373722 ἶἚῖἋΠ ΓΝ They do not put off she shoe?
Rabbi Ba, Rabh Judah say, in the name of Rabh‚ If Elias
should come, and should say, ‘ They pull off the skoe of the
husband's brother, let them hearken to him ε’ if he should say,
‘ They pull off the sandal‚' let them not hearken to him. And
yet, for the most part, the custom is to pull off the sandab .-

ther by nailst. There were some sandals also made of rushes,
or of the bark os paln1-trees11, &a Another difference also
between shoes and sandals is illustrated by a notable story
in the tract Sekabbcctlc, in the place just now cited: “In a
certain time of persecution, when some were hidden in a cave,
they said among themselves, ‘ He that will enter, let him
enter, for he will look about him before he enters, that the
enemies see him not: but let none go out; for perhaps the
enemies will be near, whom he sees not when he goes out,
and so all will be discovered! One of them by chance put
on his sandals the wrong way: for sandals were open both
ways, so that one might put in his foot either before or be-
