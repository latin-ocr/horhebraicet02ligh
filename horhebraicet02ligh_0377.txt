Ch. xxvii. 52] Emzvitate'ons upon St. Mattheu·. 371

trouble, as Aruch plainly affirms, and they hung up two veils,
that they might be sure to offend neither against this part-
nor that.

You will wonderq, therefore, that Matthew doth not say
καταπετάσματα, veils, in the plural; or perhaps you will think
that only one of these two veils was rent, not both. But it was
enough for the evangelists Matthew and Mark, who spe-ak of
this miracle, to have shewed that that fence between, which
hindered soeing into the Holy of Holies‚ and going into it,
was cle-ft and broken. This is it they mean, not being soli-
citous in explaining particulars, but contented to have de-
clared the thing itself. Perhaps the priest‚ who offered the
incense that eveniug, was in the Temple at the very moment
when this miracle happened: and when he went out amazed
to the people, and should tell them, The vez‘l of the Temple is

the Holy of Holies by some astonishing and miraculous rend—

of the outward hanging, and the north side of the inner ¹⁵.

impute the rending of the hangings to the earthquake‚ but it
must be ascribed rather to another peculiar miracle3 since it
is more proper for an earthquake to break hard things than
solt, and to rend rocks rather than curtains. Rocks were
rent by it in those places where sepulchres had been built, so
that now the gates of the resurrection were thrown open, the
bonds of the grave were unloosed, and the bodies of dead
men wore made ready, as it were, for their rising again when
Christ, the firstfruits‚ was raised. The Jews had a fancy that
the kingdom of the Messias would begin with the resurrection
of the dead, as we have noted before; vainly indeed, as to
their sense of it ; but not without some truth, as to the
thing itself : for from the resurrection of Christ the glorious
