streets of Tsippor, and going four cubits, and then praying
the additionary prayer.”

Two things especially shew their hypocrisy here:

1. That so much provision is made concerning reciting the
phylacteries‚ and the prayers added (that it might be done
within the just time), that wheresoever a man had been, when
the set time was come, he presently betakes himself to prayers:
‘⁶ A workman, or he that is upon the top of a tree, he that
rides on an ass, must immediately come down, and say his
prayerS,’' &a These are the very instances that the canonists
give, which, with more of them, you may find in the tract
Beracothc. Hence, therefore, those vainglorious hypocrites
got an occasion of beasting themselves. For the hour of the
phylacterical prayers being come, their care and endeavour
was, to be taken in the streets : whereby the canonical hour
compelling them to their prayers in that place, they might be
the more seen by all personS, and that the ordinary people
might admire and applaud both their zeal and religion. To
which hypocritical pride they often added this also, that they
used very long pauses, both before they began their prayers,
and after they had doned them: so that very usually, for
three hours together, they were seen in a praying habit and
posture. See the Babylonian Talmude. So that the Canon-
ists played the madmen with some reason, when they allowed
the space, from the rising of the morning to the third hour of
the day, for the phylacterical prayers3 because those three-
hour praying men scarcely despatched them within less space,
pausing one hour before they began prayer, and as much after
they were ended.

2. They addicted themselves to ejaculations, prayers, and
blessingS, upon the sight almost of any thing meeting them
either in the streets or in the way. “ Whenf one saw a place,
wherein some mir-acle was done for Israel 3 a place, from
whence idolatry was rooted out; or a place, where an idol
now was, a short prayer was to be used. When any saw a
blackamoor, a dwarf, a crooked, a maimed person, &c. they
were to bless. Let him that sees a fair tree‚ or a beautiful
