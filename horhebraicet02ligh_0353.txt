is not yet brought: and this is not meant simply of lettuce‚ unless
when there be other herbs.” ,ΠΞΠ ΠἾΞἾΞί) wilm& Ἲς] His
meaning is this, before he comes to those bitter herbs which
he eats after the unleavened bread, when he also gives thanks
for the eating of the bitter herbs‚ “as it is written‚'' Ye shall
eat (it) with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: “ F irst un-
leavened bread, and then bitter herbs. And this first dipping
is used only for that reason, that children may observe and
inquire3 sor it is unusual for men to eat herbs before meat.'''

III. “ Afterward there is set on unleavened bread, and the
sauce called ΠΞἹἾΠ, and the lamb, and the fiesh also of
the ΟΙιαῃὶῃαΙι of the fourteenth day.’' Maimonides doth not
take notice of any interposition between the setting on the
bitter herbs5 and the setting on the unleavened bread ε but the
Talmudic Misna notes it in these words; ΠΣΞῸ ἹὮΞῖῗ· 'twa-1
They set unleaveozed bread before him. WVhere the Gloss,
‘⁶ This is said, because they have moved the table from before
him who performed the duty of the Passover: now that re-
moval of the table was sor this end, that the son might ask
the father, and the father answered him, ‘ Let them bring the
table again, that we may make the second dipping ;' then the
son would ask, ‘ Why do we dip twice ?' Therefore they bring
back the table with unleavened bread upon it, and bitter
herbs‚'’ Sco.

IV. He begins, and blesseth, ‘⁶ ‘ Blessed be He that created
the fruits of the earth :³ and he takes the herbs and (lips
them in the sauce Clam-osez& and eats as much as an olive,
he, and all that lie down with him; but less than the quantity
of an olive he must not eat: then they remove the tableh
from before the master of the familyi.” Whether this removal
of the table be the same with the former is not much worth
our inquiry‚

V· ”RD Di: ³³7 ’1λῖῗῦ “Now they minyle tlze second cup for
Izim .· and the son asks the father3 01· if the son doth not ask
him, he tells him himself, how much this night differs from
all other nights. ‘On other nights (saith he) we dip but
once, but this night twice. On other nights we eat either
leavened or unleavened bread3 on this, only unleavened‚ &c.
