ous malice and blasphemy (as all their writings are), that
they seem only to have conl'essed the truth, that they might
have matter the more liberally to reproach him; for so they
speak: “ When J annaig the king slew the Rabbins, R. Josua
Ben Perachiah, and Jesus, went away unto Alexandria in
Egypt. Simeon Ben Shetah sent thither, speaking thus,
⁶ From me Jerusalem the holy city, to thee, Ο Alexandria in
Egypt, my sister, health. My husband dwells with thee,
while I, in the mean time, sit alone. Therefore h he rose up,
a‘nd went.’' And a little after3 ‘⁶ He brought forth four
hundred trumpets, and anathematized” [J esus]. And a little
before that, “ Elisaeus turned away Grehazi with both his
hands, and R. J osua Ben Perachiah thrust away Jesus with
both his hands.”

in the cutting which was in his flesh ?'' Under the name of
Ben Satda they wound our Jcsus with their reproaches,
although the Glosser upon the place, from the authority of
R. Tam, denies it: for thus he3 R. Tam saith, This was not

the days of Paphus, the son of Judah‚ who was in the days of
R. Akiba: but J esus was in the days of R. J osua, the son of
Perachiah,'' διο.

star had shone, and Christ was born. The reason of the
tarrying of J oseph and Mary in Beth-lehem was this; that
they believed that the Messias, who, according to the pro-
phet was born there, should have been brought up nowhere
but there als03 nor dared they to carry him elsewhere, before
they had leave to do so by an angel from heaven.

The J ewish nation are very purblind, how and whence the
Messias shall arise3 and “ Nemo novit, no man knows whence
the Son of man is,'' John vii. 27 ; that is, from what original.

Only it was confessed by all without controversy, that he
