xix. 14,‘'‘H1) δὲ παρασκευὴ τοῦ Πάσχα, ὥρα δὲ ὡσεὶ ἕκτη· And it
was the preparation of tho Passover, aad about the sioetk ἦσαν,-
namely, when Pilate delivered him to be crucified. From the
former clause, a was the preparation of tlte Passovor, hath
sprung that opinion, of which we have said something before
concerning the transferring of the eating of the lamb this year
to the fifteenth day. For they think by the preparation of the
Passover is to be understood the preparation of the lamb, or
for the eating of the lamb. For which interpretation they
think that makes, which is said by the same John, chap. xviii.
28, “ They would not go into the judgment-hall‚ lest they
should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.’'
And hence it is eonfidently concluded by them, that however
Christ ate his lamb the day before, yet the Jews vvere to eat
theirs this very day.

We will discourse first of the day, as it here occurs under
the name of παρασκευὴ τοῦ πάσχα, the preparation of tke Pass-
ovor,· and then of the how:—

I. Everyr‘ Israelite was bound, within that seven days' so-
lemnity, after the lamb was eaten, to these two things: 1. To
appear before the Lord in the court, and that with a sacrifice.
2. To solemn joy and mirth, and that also with sacrifices The
former was called by the Jews ΠἫΝἾ Appearance. The latter
ΠΣΡἎΠ Chayiyah, tho festival.

thus ; “ All are bound to make their appearance from that
precept, ‘ All thy males shall appear,' Sec. Exod. xxiii. 17:
and it is necessary that they appear in the court in the feast.
He that appears when he placeth himself in the court, let him
bring a burnt offering‚ which is by no means to be of less
price than two pieces of silver‚ that is, of two meahs of silvcr.
