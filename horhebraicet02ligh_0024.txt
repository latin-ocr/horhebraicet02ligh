parted from one another for ninety days, that judgment may
be made between children begotten in holiness,” (that is,
within the true religion3 see 1 Cor. vii. 14,) “ and children
begotten out of holiness.''

Ver. 19 : Ἰωσὴφ δὲ δίκαιος ὢν, διο. But Josepla, beiny α just
man, &c.] There is no need to rack the word δίκαιος, just, to
fetch out thence the sense of yeaztleuess or marey, which many
do; for, construing the clauses of the verse separately, the
sense will appear clear and soft enough, Josepla, beiny α just
man, could not, would not, endure an adulteress: but yet not
willinq παραδειγματίσαι, to make laer α public example, being a
merciful man, and loving his wife, Quas minded to put laer away
privilgt.

Παραὸειγματίσαι· To make laer a public example] This doth
not imply death, but rather public disgrace‚ ΠΕΟἾΞι) to make
her public. For it may, not without reason, be inquire&
whether she would have been brought to capital punishment,
if it had been true that she had conceived by adultery. For
although there was a law promulged of punishing adultery
with death, Lev. xx. 10, Deut.l xxii. 22, and, in this case, she
that was espoused, would be dealt withal after the same
manner as it was with her who was become a wife3 yet
so far was that law modified, that I say not weakened, by the
law of giving a bill of divorce, Deut. xxiv. 1, &c., that the
husband might not only pardon his adulterous wife, and not
compel her to appear before the Sanhedrim, but scarcely
could, if he would, put her to death. For why otherwise was
the bill of divorce indulged?

J oseph, therefore, endeavours to do nothing here, but what
he might, with the full consent both of the law and nation.
The adulteress might be put away3 she that was espoused
could not be put away without a bill of divorce3 concerning
which thus the Jewish lawsm ε “ A woman is espoused three
ways ; by money, or by a writing, or by being lain with.
And being thus espoused, though she were not yet married,
nor conducted into the man’s house, yet she is his wife.
And if any shall lie with her beside him, he is to be punished
with death by the Sanhedrim. And if he himself will put her
away, he must have a bill of divorce.”
