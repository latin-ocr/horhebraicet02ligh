themselves, Hyrcanus was besieged within Jerusalem, and
Aristobulus was without. The besieged sent money in a
box let downz by a rope; and they which were without
bought with it the daily sacrifices, which were drawn up by
those that were within. Among the besiegers there was one
skilled in the Greek learning, who said, ‘As long as they
thus perform the service of the Temple, they will not be de-
livered into your hands.' The next day, therefore, they let
down their money, and these sent them back a hog. When
the hog was drawing up, and came to the middle of the wall,
he fixed his hoofs to the wall, and the land of Israel was
shaken, &c From that time they said, ‘ Cursed be he who
keeps hogS, and cursed be he who teacheth his son the wis-
dom of the Greeks.7 ’' This story is cited in Menaohotha.

Therefore you will wonder, and not without cause, at that
which is related in their Talmud z ‘⁵ Theyb said sometimes to
Rabh Judah, There is a plague among the swine. He there-
fore appointed a fast.” What! is a J ew concerned for a
plague among swine? But the reason is added : ‘⁵ For Rabh
Judah thought that a stroke laid upon one kind of cattle
would invade all.'’

You may not, therefore, improperly guess, that these hogs
belonged not to the Jews, but to the heathen dwelling among
the Gadarene Jews 3 for such a mixture was very usual in
the cit-ies and countries of the land of Israel. Which we
observe elsewhere of the town Susitha or Hippo, but some
small distance from Gadara.

OrC if you grant that they were Jews, their manners will
make that opinion probable‚ as being persons whose highest
law the purse and profit was wont to be. Since brawn and
swine's flcsh were of so great account with the Romans and
other heathens, there is no reason to believe that a Jew was
held so sti-aitly by his canons, as to value them before his
own profit, when there was hope of gain.
