Ch. i. 2 .] Emmvatz'ons ¹copon St. Mad: 395

my very ancient onc, in which we read, ἐι] Ἠσαίᾳ τῷ προ-
φήτῃ, in Esaias tlte prophet.”

The whole knot of the question lies in the cause of
changing the reading3 why, as it is written in Esaias the
prophet, should be changed into, as fit is written in tlce pro-
plzets. The cause is manifest, saith that very learned man,
namely, because a double testimony is taken out of two
prophets. ‘⁶ But there could be no cause (saith he) of
changing of theni.’' For if Mark, in his own manuscript,
wrote, as it is written in the prophets, by what way could this
reading at last creep in, as it 2'3 written in Esaias, when two
prophets are manifestly cited Ξ

Reader, will you give leave to an innocent and modest
guess3 Ι am apt to suspect that in the copies of the J ewish
Christians it was read, in Isaiah, the prophet‚· but in those
of the Gentile Christians, in the prophete .· and that the
change among the Jews arose from hence, that St. Mark
seems to go contrary to a most received canon and custom
of the Jewse: ‘⁶ He that reads the prophets in the syna-
gogues, &³2:37 &³230 Γλζῖῆζὶ ΓΝ Zet him not skip from one
prophet to another. But in the lesser prophets he may skip3
with this provision only, that he skip not backward : that is,
not from the latter to the former.⁷'

But you see how Mark ships here (from whom far be it
to be subject to such foolish canons) from a prophet of one
rank, namely, from a prophet who was one of the twelve‚ to
a prophet of another rank: and you see also how he ships
backward from Malachi to Isaiah. This, perhaps, was not so
pleasing to the Christian Jews, too much J udaizing yet: nor
could they well bear that this allegation should be read in
their churches so differently from the common use. Hence,
in Isaialc the prophet, was inserted for in the proplaets. And
that they did so much the more boldly‚ because those words
which are cited out of Malachi are not exactly agreeable
either to the Hebrew original or the Greek version, and
those that are cited from Isaiah are cited also by Matthew
and Luke3 and the sense of them which arc cited from
Malachi may also be fetched from the place alleged out· of
Isaiah.
