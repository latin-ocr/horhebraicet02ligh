308 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxiii. 7, &cn

2, The consent of the whole people was more universal to
his death.

3. He was a more proper and apparent type of Christ.

4. The requiring of vengeance is mentioned only conoerning
Abel and Zechariah: “Beliold11, the voice of thy brother’s
blood crieth unto me.” And, “ Let⁰ the Lord look upon it,
and require itf'

5. In this the death of Christ agrees exactly with the death
of Zechariah3 that, although the city and nation of the Jews
did not perish till about forty years after the death of Christ,
yet they gave themselves their death's wound in wounding
Christ. So it was also in the case of Zechariah: Jerusalem
and the people of the Jews stood indeed many years after the
death of Zechariah‚ but from that time began to sink, and
draw towards ruin. Consult the story narrowly, and you will
plainly find, that all the affairs of the Jews began to decline
and grow worse and worse, from that time when ‘⁶ blood
⁶ touched bloodl‘,’' (the blood of the sacrificer mingled with the
blood of the sacrifice), and when “ the people became conten-
tious ancl rebellious against the priests?

‘⁶ Butr now murderers ;'’ “ They have killed (saith he) Uriah,
they have killed Zechariali.” Also on these words, “ Yours

he) Zeohariah and Isaiah.” “ Simeont Ben Azzai said, ‘I have
found a book of genealogies at Jerusalem, in which it was
written, Manasseh slew lsai-ahs “³ &a
