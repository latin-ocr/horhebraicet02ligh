wine and 0i1‚ to anoint a sick man on the sabbath.’'

Το these may be added, if need were, the frequent (shall I
say ἓ) or infinite use of the phraseS, ἾΓἾἾὩἾ ἾἾΟΝ bound and
loosed, which we meet with thousands of times over. But from
these allegat-icus, the reader sees abundantly enough both the
frequency and the common use of this phrase, and the sense
of it also3 namely, first, that it is used in doctrine, and in
judgments, concerning things allowed or not allowed in the
law. Sccondly, That to &incl is the same with to forbid, or to
declaro forbidden. Το think that Christ, when he used the
common phrase, was not understood by his hearers in the
common and vulgar sense, shall I call it a matter of laughter
or of madness (ἰ

'Po this, therefore, do these words amount ε When the time
was come, wherein the Mosaic law, as to some part of it, was
to be abolished and left off3 and as to another part of it, was
to be continued, and to last for ever ε he granted Peter here,
and to the rest of the apostles, chap. xviii. 18, a power to
abolish or confirm what they thought good, and as they
thought good, being taught this and led by the Holy Spirit:
as if he should say, “ Whatsoever ye shall bend in the law of
Moses, that is, forbid, it shall be forbidden, the Divine au-
thority confirming it ; and whatsoever ye shall loose, that is,
permit, or shall teaolz, that it is permitted and lawful, shall be
Zawfzd and permitted.”

Hence they bound, that is, fortudo, circumcision to the be·-
lievers3 eating of things offered to idols, of things strangled,
and of blood for a time to the Gentiles; and that which they
bound on earth was confirmed in heaven. They hosed, that is,
allowed purification to Paul, and to four other brethren, for
the shunning of scandal, Acts xxi. 24:.and in a word, by these
words of Christ it was committed to them, the Holy spirit
directing that they should make decrees concerning religion,
as to the use or rejection of Mosaic rites and judgments‚ and
that either for a time or for ever.
