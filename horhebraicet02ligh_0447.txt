vealed.” In the Chaldee it is, UDlJ'D '’521ss A king] shall

“ Inu like manner in the same book: R. Samuel Bar Na-
chaman said, It happened that Elias went by the way in the
day wherein the destruction of the Temple waS, and he heard
a certain voice crying out and saying, ‘The holy Temple is
destroyed.' Which when he heard, he imagined how he could
destroy the world: but travelling forward he saw men
ploughing and sowing, to whom he said, ⁶ God is angry with
the world and will destroy his house, and lead his children
captives to the Gentiles3 and do you labour for temporal
victualsss' And another voice was heard, saying, ‘Let them
work, for the Saviour of Israel is born.⁷ And Elias said,
‘ Where is he ’θ’ And the voice said, ⁶ In Bethlehem of J udah,' '³
&a These words this author speaks, and these words they
speak.

ΙΙ. As it is not without good reason gathered, that Christ
shall be born before the destruction of the city, from that
clause, “Before she travailed she brought forth, before her
bringing forth came [πόνος τῶν ὠδίνων, the pomfys of travail}
she brought forth a male child ;’' so also, from that clause,
εἰ ἐτέχθη ἔθνος εἷς ἅπαξ, ὅτι ὤδινε καὶ ἔτεκε Σιὼν, &a Is a
station brouqht forth at once? for Sion travailecl and brought
fortlz her children, is gathered as well, that the Gentiles were
to be gathered and called to the saith before that destructi0n3
which our Saviour most plainly teacheth, ver. 10, “But the
gospel must first be preached among all nations.'’ For how
the Gentiles, which should believe, are called ‘ the children of
Sion,' and ‘ the children of the church of lsrael‚' every where
in the propheta there is no need to show, for every one
knows it.

In this sense is the word ὠδίνων, panys or sorrows, in this
place to be understood; and it agrees not only with the sense
of the prophet alleged, but with a most common phrase and
opinion in the nation concerning ΠἺζΠΞ '‘721’1 the sorrows of
the Messiah, that is, concerning the calamities which they ex-
pected would happen at the coming of the Messiah.
