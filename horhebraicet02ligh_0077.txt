ferred to the public office of teaching or judging. The thing
may be illustrated by one example: ‘⁶ DlD'L) ἾΠΌ ῠἾἾἾΞΠ

[or fellows] go in to intercalate the year? Let us learn this
from the example of Rabban Gamaliel, who said, Let the
seven seniors meet me in the chamber. But eight entered,

In this sense the word ἾΞΠ a collemque, differs nothing from

student and a learned man. But the word ἾΞΠ α collacryma,
hath a wider sense, denoting all such who have more pro-
fessedly devoted themselves to religion, and have professed a
more devout life and rule than the common people, whether
they were learned or unleamed, whether of the sect of the
Pharisees, or of the Sadducees, or some other. Hence you
have mention of m: *mn al reliqious Samaritam, and of

be drawn from Psalm cxix. 63 3 ῗῐἾξὲΤ ἾΨζΥἶῖἒῖἳ ᾛδῖ ἾΖζΠ

Yet the word seems sometimes to be appropriated to the
PMrisees, as being men who, above all others, put on a
splendidly cloaked religion, which appears enough from the
history of the Gospel. So, perhaps, is that to be understood,
