4, Let them who take that supper in John xiii. for the
paschal supper, tell me how this is possible, that J udas after
the paschal supper (at which they do not deny that he was
present with the rest of the disciples) could make his agree-
ment with the priestS, and get his bladesS together ready to
apprehend our Saviour, and assemble all the council, ver. 57.
The evangelists say that he made an agreement with the
chief priests, Matt. xxvi. 14, καὶ τοῖς στρατηγοῖς, <md with the
captains, Luke xxii. 4, and “ with all the council,” Mark xiv.
10, 11. But now, which way was it possible that he could
bargain with all these int so small a space as there was
between the going out of Judas from supper and the be-
traying of our Lord in the garden? What! were these all
together at supper that night? This isamatter to be laughed
at rather than credited. Did he visit all these from door to
door? And this is as little to be thought, since he had scarce
time to discourse with any one of them. Every one supped
this night at home, the master of a family with his family.
It would be ridiculous to suppose that these chief priests
supped together, while, in the mean time, their families sat
down at home without their head. It is required by the law
that every master of a family should be with his family that
night, instructing them, and performing sacred rites with
and for them. These were, therefore, to be sought from
house to house by J udas, if that were the first time of his
treating with them about this matter : and let reason answer
whether that little time he had were sufficient for this? We
affirm, therefore, with the authority of the evangelistS, that
that supper, John xiii, was before the Passover3 at which,
Satan entering into Juclas, he bargained with the priests
before the Passover, he appointed the time and place of his
betraying our Saviour, and all things were by them made
ready for this wicked deed before the Passover came. Ob-
serve the method and order of the story in the evangelists,
Matt. xxvi. 14—173 Mark xiv. lo—12: ‘⁴ Then went Judas to
the priests, and said, ‘ What will ye give me,5 &a And from
that time he sought opportunity to betray him. Now, the
first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came
