struction of the second Temple: and from Rabban Jochanan
Ben Zaccai, who were all presidents. And the title also of
Rabbi began from those that were promoted [to be elflers]
from that time, Babba· Zadok‚ and R. Eliezer Ben Jacob: and
the thing went forth from the disciples of Rabban J ochanan
Ben Zaccai, and onwards. Now the order, as all men use it,
is this: Babba· is greater than Rabh, and Rabban is greater
than Rabbz'‚· and he is greater who is called by his own
(single) name, than he who is called Rabbaffl

Thath this haughty title of Babba was not in use before
the times of Hillel sufficiently appears from thence, that the
doctors before that were called by their plain names, and
knew nothing of this title. Antigonus Socheus, Shelnaiah
and Abtalion‚ Gebihah Ben Pesisa, Galba Savua, Admon and
Hanan, Hillel and Shammai, and many others, whose names
we meet with in the Jewish story. Yet you shall find these,
that were more ancient, sometimes officiously honoured by
the writers of their nation with this title, which they them-
selves were strangers to. They feigni that king Jehoshaphat
thus called the learned men: “XVhen he saw (say they) a
disciple of the wise men, he rose up out of his throne and
embraced him, and kissed him, and called him ¹¹2& ³2&
’ἾῸ ἾἾΌ ἾΞἾ ἮἾ O Father, Faffler, Rabbi, Babba Lorcl,
Lord.” And J oshua Ben Perachiak is called Babba: J oshua.

‘famen' in the ninth; and ‘masten' καθηγητὴς, in the tenth.
We do not too nicely examine the precise time when this
title began; be sure it did not commence before the schism
arose between the schools of Shammai and Hillel : and from
that schism, perhaps, it had its beginning.
