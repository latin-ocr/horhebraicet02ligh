whole body. But for smaller uncleannesses it was enough to
cleanse the hands.

ΙΙ. Much less is it to be understood of the things bought ;
as if they, when they were bought for the market, were to
be washed (in which sense some interpretem render the
words, “ And what they buy out of the market, unless they
wask it, they eat it not'')‚ when there were some things which
