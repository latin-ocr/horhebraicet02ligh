348 Hebrew and Talmudioal [Oh. xxvi. 26.

On other nights we eat either sitting or lying; on this, all
lying.' '⁷

VI. “The table is set before them again3 and then he
saith, ⁸ This is the passover, which we therefore eat, because
God passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt.7 Then
he lifts up the bitter herbs in his hand and saith, ‘ We there-
fore eat these bitter herbs, because the Egyptians made the
lives of our fathers bitter in Egypt.' He takes up the un-
leavened bread in his hand, and saith, ‘ We eat this unleavened
bread, because our fathers had not time to sprinkle their
meal to be leavened before God revealed himself and redeemed
them. We ought therefore to praise, celebrate, honour, mag-
nify, διο. him, who wrought all these wonderful things for our
fathers and for us, and brought us out of bondage into liberty,
out of sorrow into joy, out of darkness into great light3 let
us therefore say, Hallelujah: Praise the Lord, praise him, O
ye servants of the Lord, 850. to, And the flint-stone into
fountains of waters' [that is, from the beginning of Psalm
cxiii to thc end of Psalm cxiv]. And he concludes, ‘ Blessed
be thou, Ο Lord God, our King etei-nal, redeeming us, and
redeeming our fathers out of Egypt, and bringing us to this
night; that we may eat unleavened broad and bitter herbs :'
and then he drinks off the second cup.”

VII. “ Then washing his hands, and taking two loaves, he
breaks one, and lays the broken upon the whole one, and
blesseth it3 ‘ Blessed be he who causeth bread to grow out
of the earth :' and putting some bread and bitter herbs toge-
ther, he dips them in the sance Charoseth,—and blessing,
‘Blessed be thou, O Lord God, our eternal King, he who
hath sanctified us by his precepts‚ and hath commanded us
to eat,’ he eats the unleavened bread and bitter herbs toge-
ther3 but if he eats the unleavened bread and bitter herbs
by themselves, he gives thanks severally for each. And after-
ward, giving thanks after the same manner over the flesh of
the Okayz'yalc of the fourteenth day, he eats also of it, and in
like manner giving thanks over the lamb, he eats of it.''

VI II. “ From thenceforward he lengthens out the supper,
eating this or that as he hath a mind, and last of all he eats
of the flesh of the passover, at least as much as an olive;
but after this he tastes not at all of any food.'' Thus far
