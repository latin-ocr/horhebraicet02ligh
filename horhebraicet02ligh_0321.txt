The Rabbins dream that God shortened the day on which
wicked king Ahab died, and that ten hours3 lest he should
have been honoured with mourning a,

Ver. 24: Δώσουσι σημεῖα μεγάλα καὶ τέρατα· Shall show
yreat sifflzs and wonders] It is a disputable case, whether the
Jewish nation were more mad with superstition in matters of
religion, or with superstition in curicus arts.

Ι. There was not a people upon⁴ earth that studied or
attributed more to dreams than they. Hence

1. They often imposed fastings upon themselves to this
end, that they might obtain happy dreams; or to get the
interpretation of a dream3 or to divert the ill omen of a
dream: which we have observed at the foui-teenth verse of
the ninth chapter.

2. Hence their nice rules for handling of dreamsb3 such
as these, and the like: ΠΞῖΠ ‘'2: *Ty mm ΞἾῖῚΠί) ΕΠΝ ,7²:22³
Let one observa cc good dream two-ancl-twentys years, after the
example of J osephc: ‘⁶ If you go to bed merry, you shall
have good dreams d,'' 850.

3. Hence many took upon them the public profession of
interpreting dreams3 and this was reckoned among the
nobler arts. A certain old man (Babyl. Beracoth e) relates
this story3 ‘⁶ There were four-and-twenty interpreters of
dreams in Jerusalem : and Ι, having dreamed a dream, went
to them all: every one gave a different interpretation, and
yet they all came to pass,” 816. You havef R. Joses Ben
Chelpatha, R. Ismael Ben R. J oses, R. Lazar, and R. Akiba
interpreting divers dreams, and many coming to them for
interpretation of their dreams. Nay, you see there the dis-
ciples of R. Lazar in his absence practising this art. See
there also many stories about this business, which it would
be too much here to transcribe.

II. There were hardly any people in the whole world that
more used, or were more fond of, amulets, charnis, mutter-
ings‚ exorcisms‚ and all kinds of enchantments. We might
herc produce innumerable examples; a handful shall serve
us out of the harvest: ΠΠὩἸΌΠ ’(13 wrm) ’(13Ὡὲ ὩἾὈρΞ &³7³
