disputes.

Ὠρχήσατο ἡ θυγάτηρ, Sco. The dauylcter of Herodias dam-ed]
Not so much out of lightneSS, as according to the custom of
the nation, namely, to express joy and to celebrate the day.
The Jews were wont in their public and more than ordinary
rejoicings, and also in some of their holy festivals, to express
their cheerfulness by leaping and dancing. Omitting the ex-
amples which occur in the holy Bible, it is reported by the
Fathers of the Traditions‚ that the chief part of the mirth in
the feast of Tabernacles consisted in such kind of dancing:
the chief men, the aged, and the most religious, dancing in
the Court of the Women3 and by how much the more vehe-
mently they did it, so much the more commendable it was.
Ther gesture, therefore, or motion of the girl that danced
took not so much with Herod, as her mind and affection:
namely, because hereby she shewed honour towards his* birth-
dayS‚ and love and respect towards him, and joy for his life
aud health: from whom, indeed, Herod had little deserved
such things, since he had deprived her father Philip of his
wife, and defiled her mother with unlawful wedlock and con-
tinual incest.

Ver. 7 t: Μεθ’ ὅρκου ὡμολόγησεν αὐτῇ, &Q He promised her
with om oatk, dra] This kind of oath is called by the Tal-
mudists ἾἹὯΞ Πῃᾛῐῃ α rask oatlz: concerning which see
Mai1n0nides¹1, and the Talmudic tract under that title. If ”
the form of the oath were “b'y his head,'' whichx was very
usual, the request of the maid very fitly, though very un-
justly, answered to the promise of the king3 as if she should
say, ‘ You swore by your head that you would give me what-
soever I shall ask ς give me, then, the head of John Baptist.'
