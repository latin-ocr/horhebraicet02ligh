392 DEDICATION.

other3 on one hand how unworthy I am of so great favour, and
how altogether unable to make any recompenso on the other 3 what
else is left me but to fly again to the same kindness, humbly im—
ploring it, that as it at first so obligingly received me, a person
unknown and unworthy 3 so it would now entertain me, known and
bound by so great obligation, and approaching with all the thanks I
can give. Those thanks so due to your honour Ι have committed to
these papers 3 unlearned indeed they are, and undressed [impolitis] ,-
but such as carry sincerity with them, though not learning, thankful-
ness, though not eloquence. And Ι have intrusted this charge with
them the rather, because I suppose they may disperse themselves
far and near, and perhaps may live to posterity : and that which I
desire of them is, that they would declare to all how indebted he is
to your honour, and to your great humanity, with how great obli-
gations he is bound to you, and with how grateful a mind and
inward affection he professeth all this, and will aoknowledge it for

ever, who is,
My Lord,

Your Honour's most obliged servant,

J OHN LIGHTFOOT.
