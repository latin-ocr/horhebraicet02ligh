'1' ΠῙῚἾΞὩ seed fallz‘ny out of the hand.- that is, that is cast
out of the hand of the sower: and of ΞἾἾἾἾΨ ,ΠῘἋΞῺ seed
falliny from theooeen .· that is, “ that which is scattered and
sown'' by the sowing oxen. “ For (as the Gloss speaks)
sometimes they sow with the hand, and sometimes they put
the seed into a cart full of holes, and drive the oxenz upon
the ploughed earth, and the seed falls through the holes.''

Ver. 5: Διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βάθος γῆς· Because it laad no depth
of earth] For it was rocky, whose turf nevertheless was thick
enough, and very fruitful; but this ground which the parable
supposeth wanted that thickness. “Youa have not a more
fruitful land among all lands than the land of Egypt3 nor a
more fruitful country in Egypt than Zoan. And yet Hebron,
which was rocky, exceeded it sevenfold.’' Note that ‘ it
was roffy, and yet so fruitfuls

Ver. 7 ε Εἰς τὰς ἀκάνθας· Amonq thorn-sn] The parable sup-

Ver. 1 1 ⁰ : Ἐκείυοις δὲ τοῖς ἔξω· Unio them that are without]
Οἱ ἔξω, those without, in Jewish speech, were the Gentiles;
a phrase taken hence, that they called all lands and countries
besides their own, ῩἾΝῙἹ ΠΒἸΠ without the land. Would you
have an exact instance of this distinction? ‘⁶ A tree d, half of
which grows within the land of Israel, and half without the
land, the fruits of it which are to be tithed, and the common
fruits are confounded: they are the words of Rabba. But
Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith, ‘ That part which grows
within the place, that is bound to tithing” [that is, within
the land of Israel]‚ “is to be tithed: that which grows in the
place free from tithing” (that is, without the land) “is free.”
The Gloss is, “ Foris the roots of the tree are without the
land, it is free, although the tree itself extends itself sixteen
cubits within the land.”

Hence ΒἾἾΞἺἾ ΕῚἾΒΟ books οἱ ἔξω, that are without, are
heathen books: nnn* nram-1 ἵνα) amyrin niano extra-

This is the common signification of the phrase. And,
certainly it foretells dreadful things, when our blessed. Sa-
