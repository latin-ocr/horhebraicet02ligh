soever ye shall fly, tell this abroad in my name everywhere, and to
every man, that although there be nothing else in you worthy to be
read, yet that this my sineere profession may be read and heard 5
that, next after the divine merey, Ι owe to the mer-ey of the king,
that I enjoy this sweet leisure for learning, that I enjoy these quiet
retirements, that I enjoy a house, that I enjoy myself.

So, O father of the country, may the Father of mereies reward you
sevenfold, and seventy times sevenfold into your bosom, and may
you feel every day the benefit and sweetness of doing good by the
recompenses that are made you by Heaven. Thus may your mer-cy
ever triumph, and ever reap as the fruit of it the eternal favour of
the Divine merey. Thus may England be erowned for a long time
with her king 3 and may the king be crowned for ever with the love
of God, with his protection, his blessing, his grace, his glory.
