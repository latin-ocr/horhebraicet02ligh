same with this, What part of this time they do allot to the
washingz of the disciples' feet? what part to Judas’s going
out? and what part to his discoursing with the priests, and
getting ready his accompliees for their wicked exploit3

I. It seems strange, indeed, that Christ should put off the
washing of the disciples' feet to the paschal supper, when,
1. That kind of aetion was not only unusual and unheard of
at that supper, but in nowise necessary or fitting: for, 2.
How much more conveniently might that have been per-
formed at a common supper before the Passover, as we
suppose, when he was not straitened by the time, than at
the paschal supper, when there were many things to be done
which required despatch Ξ

ΙΙ. The office of the paschal supper did not admit of such
interruption‚ nor was it lawful for others so to decline from
the fixed rule as to introduce sueh a foreign matter: and why
should Christ so swerve from it, when in other things he con-

in the least dreamed of ; they would not, they could not,
suppose it. Yon see how light a matter Judas's going away
to buy necessarios, as the disciples interpreted it, seemed to
them, because he went away from a common supper: but if
they had seen him thus dismissed, and sent away from the
paschal supper, it would have seemed a monstrous and won-
derful thing. What! to leave the paschal supper, now begun,
to go to market! To go from a common supper at Bethany,
to buy necessaries for the Passover‚ against the time of the
Passover, this was nothing strange or unusual: but to go
