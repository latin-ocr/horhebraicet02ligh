IV. Now appears ΠΞΞΓἸ ζῢζῖ] lumin Htw, the first feast day of
tlte Passever, when they used to present- themselves in the
Temple and offer their gifts„ Exod. xxiii. 15. But when and
how was this performed by them to-day? They take heed of
going into the judgment (or Praetor's) hall, lest they should
be defiled, but that they might eat the Οήαρὶῃαῖιθ, or Passovert ε
but you will scarce find what time they allowed to-day for that
purpose; nor indeed was it lawful for them to eat any thing
on that day3 it being provided by a canon, “ That when the
council shall have adjudged any one to die, let- them not taste
any thing that day¹¹.”

Συμβούλιον ἔλαβον ὥστε θανατῶσαι αὐτόν· T ook cowzsel to put

„³743 ΓἾῺἾΣΠ ΟἾἮ “ Oases Χ of money] are heardy in the day-
time, and magt be determina] in the m'gyht. Capital causes are
tried in the day, and finished in the day. J udgment in cases
of money is passed the same day, whether it be for fining or
acquitting. J udgment in capital causes is passed the same
day, if it be sor acquitting: but if it be for condemning, it is
passed the day after.'' The reason of this difference is given
by the Gen1arists; whom see. The reason of the latter is thus
expressed: 5:³7 ΠΝ {mmmm ΓἾἾΠ ἿἾΨΝ Blessed is the
jadye who leveneth leis judyment: that is, as the Gloss, “ who
delays his judgment, and lets it rest all night, tha-t he may
sift out the truth.”

The difference between 3³37 and ΓἾῩΞἸᾸ 18 greater than the
reader may perhaps think at first sight. By the word 1³17
they signify the whole process of the trial, the examining of
the plaintiff and defendant, and of the witnesses‚ the taking
the vot-es of the council, and the entering of them by the
scribes: ΓἾὩἹἎ signifies only the passing of judgment, or
giving a definitive sentence. You may better perceive the
difference from the Glossary on Babyl. Sanhedrinzz in the text
