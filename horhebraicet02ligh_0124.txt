118 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. v. 27, &c.

The prutalz, as it was the least piece of money among the
Jews, so it seems to have been a coin merely J ewish, not
Roman. For although the Jews, being subjects to the Ro-
mans, used Roman money, and thence, as our Saviour argues,
confessed their subjection to the Rornan83 yet they were per-
mitted to use their own money, which appears by the com-
mon use of the shekels and half-shekels among them: with
good reaeon, therefore, one may hold the κοδράντης, the far-
thiny, was the least Roman coin, and the λεπτὸν, the prutak,
the least Jewish. Whilst our Saviour mentions both, he is
not inconstant to his own speech, but speaks more to the
capacity of all.

Ver. 27: 'onz‘to-arf, ὅτι ἐρρέθη τοῖς ἀρχαίοις, Οὐ μοιχεύσεις· Ye
hare laem-cl, that ic ham been said by them of old time, Thou skalt
ποτ commit adulteryj He citeth not the command or text of
Moses, as barely delivered by Moses, but as deformed by
those of old time with such a gloss as almost evacuated all
the force of the command3 for they interpreted it of the act
of adultery only, and that with a married woman. So the
enumeration of the six hundred and thirteen precepts of the
law, and that, Exod. xx.14, ‘ Thou shalt not commit adultery‚'
hath these words, ‘⁴ This is the thirty-fifth precept of the laW‚
namely‚ That no man lie with another man’s wife.''

Ver. 28: Πᾶς ὁ βλέπων γυναῖκα πρὸς τὸ ἐπιθυμῆσαί, 8220.

that looketh upon a woman's heel, is as if he looked upon

with her.'’ And yet, cmm: ³7an5& '':1 ΗἾ ³:³12] '¹:57 *0³
Iti was Rabbaoz Gamaliel's custom to look upon women. And
in the other Talmud 3 “ Hej that looks upon the little finger
ofa woman, is as if he looked upon her privy partes* And
yet “⁴ Rubh Gidal k and R. J ochanan were wont to sit at the
place of dipping, where the women were washed ; and when
they were admonished by some of the danger of lascivious-
ness, RJochanan answered‚ ⁶ I am of the seed of J oseph, over
whom an evil affection could not rule.’ '²
