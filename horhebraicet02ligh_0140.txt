134 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. v. 46.

whereby they are trained up in eternal hatred against the
Gentiles, and against Israelites themselves, who do not, in
every respect, walk with them in the same traditions and
rites. Let this one example be instead of very many, which
are to be met with everywhere: “ Thea heretical Israelites,
that is, they of Israel that worship idols, or who transgress,
to provoke God: also Epicurean Israelites‚ that is, Israelites
who deny the law and the prophets, are by precept to be
slain‚ if any can slay them, and that openly3 but if not
openly, you may compass their death secretly‚ and by sub-
tilty.” And a little after (ΟΞ the extreme charity of the Jews
towards the Gentiles); “ But as to the Gentiles, with whom
we have no war, and likewise to the shepherds of smaller
cattle, and others of that sort, they do not so plot their
death3 but it is forbidden them to deliver them from death
if they are in danger of it.'' For instance3 “ A J ew sees one
of them fallen into the sea; let him by no means lift him out
thence: for it is written, ‘ Thou shalt not rise up against the
blood of thy neighbour ε’ but this is not thy neighbour.'' And
further; “Anb Israelite, who alone sees another israelite
transgressing, and admonisheth him, if he repents not, is
bound to hate him.”

Ver. 46 z Οὐχὶ καὶ οἱ τελῶναι τὸ αὐτὸ ποιοῦσι; Do not even the
publicans the same ?] How odious the publicans were to the
ι] ewish nation, especially those that were sprung of that nation‚
and how they reckoned them the very worst of all mankind,
appears many ways in the evangelists 3 and the very same is
their character in their own writers.

“ Itc is not lawful to use the riches of such men, of whom
it is presumed that they were thieves; and of whom it is
presumed that all their wealth was gotten by rapine, and
that all their business was the business of extortioners, such
as publicans and robbers are 3 nor is their money to be min-
gled with thine, because it is presumed to have been gotten
by rapine.'’

Amongd those who were neither fit to judge, nor to give a
testimony in judgment, are numbered pompm ΓΝΞἎΠ the
collectors of tames, and the publicans.
