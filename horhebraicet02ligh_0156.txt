III. When Christ useth this manner of speech so very
well known to the nati0n‚ does he not use it in a sense that
was known to the nation also? Let them answer who would
have the Lord's Prayer to be prayed and said by none but
by those who are indeed believers, and who have partook of
true adoption. In what sense was our Saviour, when he spake
these words, understood of the hearers Ξ They were thoroughly
insti-noted, from their omdles, to eall God the Fatlaer in hea-
ven: they neither hear Christ changing the phrase, nor our-
tailing any thing from the latitude of the known and used
sense. Therefore let them tell me, Did not Peter, John, and
the rest of the aposffles, think that it was as lawful for all
Christians to say to God, Omn Fatlaer which art in heaven, as
it was lawful for all Jews? They called Grod Famem because
he had called them into the profession of him, because he
took care of them, and instruoted them, &a And what, I
beseech you, hinders‚ but all Ohrisfians, obtaining the same
privileges, may honour God with the same compellation?
There is nothing in the words of Christ that hinders‚ and
there is somewhat in the very phrase that permits it.
