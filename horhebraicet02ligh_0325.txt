Oh. xxiv. 28, 29.] Exercitatioozs upon St. Mattlaew. 319

Christ speaks in this place3 and Peter speaks in his Second
Epistle, third chapter3 and John, in the sixth of the Revela-
tion3 and Paul, 2 Cor. v. 17, &c

2. T hat Chrisffs taking vengeance of that exceeding wicked
nat-ion is called Christ's ‘⁶ coming in glory,” and his “ coming
in the clouds,'' Dan. vii. It is also called, “ the day of the
Lord.'' See Psahn i. 43 Mal. iii. 1, 2, &c.; Joel ii. 31 ς Matt.
xvi. 283 Rev. i. 7, &c See what we have said on chap. xii.
20 ; xix. 28. “

TheZ meaning, therefore, of the words before us is this:
‘⁶ While they shall falsely say, that Christ is to be seen here
or there: ‘ Behold, he is in the desert,' one shall say3 another,
‘ Behold, he is in the secret chambers τ’ he himself shall come,
like lightning, with sudden and altogether unexpected venge-
ance: they shall meet him whom they could not find3 they
shall find him whom they sought, but quite another than what
they looked for.

Ver. 28 : ‘'Oarov γὰρ ἐὰν ᾗ τὸ πτῶμα, &a For wheresoever the
caron-§e is, ἅσπ] I wonder any can understand these words of

God shall cast off the city and people‚ grown ripe for destruc-
tion, like a carcase thrown out, the Roman soldiers‚ like
eagleS, shall straight fly to it with their eagles (ensigns) to
tear and devour it. And to this also agrees the answer of
Christ, Luke xvii. 373 when, after the same words that are
spoke here in this chapter, it was inquired, “ Where, Lord “2'’
he answered, ‘⁶ VVheresoever the body is‚” διας silently hinting
thus much, that Jerusalem, and that wicked nation which he
described through the whole chapter, would be the carcase,
to which the greedy and devouring eagles would fly to prey
upon it.

Ver. 29: ‘O ἥλιος σκοτισθήσεται, &c. The sun shall be dark-
ened, ᾅσ] That is, the J ewish heaven shall perish, and the
sun and moon of its glory and happiness shall be dax-kened,
and brought to nothing. The sun is the religion of the church 3
the moon is the government of the state; and the δίαγε are the
