“leosoever sees α dead corpse (say they), ancl does not accom-

modate [or cxc-company] him to his burial, is guilty of that
which is said, ‘ He that mocketh the poor reproacheth his
Maker,’ &o But now (say they) no man is so poor as the
dead man e,” &Q

Ver. 24 f: Οὐκ ἀπέθανε τὸ κοράσιον, ἀλλὰ καθεύδει· The maid
is not dead, but sleepetlc] It was very ordinary among them
to express the death of any one by t-he word ἾὌἺ, which
properly signifies to sleep. ᾜΞἻ '52 When Ν. slept; that is,
when lae died .· a phrase to be met with hundreds of times in
the Talmudists. And this whole company would say, ,ΠΞὩἾ
ἾἾΝἾ ΠΕ lee clauylcter ofJaz‘rus sleeps3 that is, she is dead.
Therefore it is worthy considering what form of speech
Christ here used. The Syriae hath &3727 &³724 nrm Νι),
She is not dead, but asleep.

Ver. 33 ε Οὐδέποτε ἐφάνη οὕτως ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ· It was never
so seen in Israel] These words seem to refer, not to that
peculiar miraole only that was then done, but to all his mi-
racles. Oonsider how many were done in that one day, yea,
in the asternoon. Christ dines at Capernaum with Matthew:
having dined, the importunity of J airus calls him away : going
with Jairus, the woman with the issue of blood meets him,
and is healed: coming to J airus’s house, he raiseth his dead
daughter: returning to his own house (for he had a dwelling
at Capernaum), two blind men meet him in the streets, cry
out Messias after him, follow him home, and they are cured.
As they were going out of the house, a dumb demoniac enters,
and is healed. The multitude, therefore, could not but cry
out, with very good reason, “Never had any such thing ap-
peared in Israel.’' -
