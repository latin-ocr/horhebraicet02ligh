Abiatkar the hiyk priest] It is well enough known what is
here said in defence of the purity of the text; namely, that
Ahimelech the father was called Abiathar, and Abiathar the
son was called also Ahimelech. But I suppose that some-
thing more was propounded by our Saviour in these words.
For it wase common to the Jews under ΑόἱατῘιαν to under-
stand the Urim and Thummim. Nor without good reason,
when it appears, that under the father and the son, both of
that name, the mention of inquiring by Urim and Thummim
is more frequent than it is ever anywhere else3 and, after
Abiatkar the son, there is scarcely mention of it at all.
Christ therefore very properly adds, ἐπὶ Ἀβιάθαρ ἀρχιερέως,
in the days qubiatlzar the kiyh priest, therein speaking ac-
cording to a very received opinion in the nation: as though
he had said, ‘⁶ David ate the shewbread given him by the
high priest, who had the oracle by Urim and Thummim pre-
sent with him, and who acted by the divine direction.”

VER. 5 : Οἱ δὲ ἐσιώπων· But they held their peace] This re-
minds me of the like carriage of the Sanhedrim in judging a
servant of king J annaeus, a murderer, when J annaeus himself
was present in the Sanhedrimg. It was found sufficiently
that he was guilty; but, for sear, they dared not to utter
their opinion ; when Simeon Ben Sheta, president of the
Sanhedrim, required it: ὩΡἾῙῺΞ ΕΠἾΞΞ ima: uma„ mm

here. To which our very learned Hugh Broughton, a man
very well exercised in these studies, replies: “ The Jews to

Nebhyim. So Boaneryes. When Theodoro Beza will have it
