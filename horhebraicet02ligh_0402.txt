Ver. 6: Ἐυὸεδυμέυος τρίχας καμήλου· Olotked with camel’s
kair] In the Ta1mudists it would be read 1:³an mx oamees
wool: “ Hef hath not a garment besides a woollen one;
0³:2sz Ἴης-ι trbm πω mm& to add wool (or hair) of
camols, and wool of hares .· ἸΞἾἾὩΨ ΕἾῙἸὮἎ ἿὫΞἹ ῠ“ἷ7ΠἾ UD&
wooZg of sheep, and wool of camels, which they mix, &c.'' And
a little after, ΟἾίῬῺλ unm 7:22 ΠΨὩ *bem “ If he malco α
yarment of camel's hair, and weave in it but one thread of
linen‚ it is forbidden, as things of different kinds.''

Thereh is one that thinks that those garments of Adam
concerning which it is said [Gen. iii. 21.], that God made

for them ww ΠὋΙᾎξ coats of skins, were of camel's kair.-

saithi that they were like those thiu linen garments which
come from Bethshan. R. Samuel Bar Nachman saith they
were of the wool (or hair) of camele, and the wool os hares.''

We cannot pass that by without observation, that it is said,
“ That in the law of R. Meir they found written wi& nnn:
yarmeozts of liylzt, for ἾἾῺ nun: ymmonis of skiozs.'' The like
to which is that, “ Ink the law of R. Meir they found it
written, instead of ἾΝὈ mm ΠΞΠἾ Bekold, it was very qood,
ΠἹῸ ΞΥΔ mm And behold death is a qood tlainy. WVhere by
the law of R. flleir seems to be understood some volume of
the laW‚ in the margin of which, or in some papers put in,
that Rabbin had writ his critical toys and his foolish pieces
of wit upon the law, or some such trifling commentary of his
own upon it.

provision hunted after locusts for food. The Gemarists¹
feign that there are eight hundred kinds of them, namely,
of such as are clean. That lexicographer certainly would be
very acute who could describe all these kinds particularly by
their names.
