Oh. v.1.] Emercae'tations upon St. Mark. 409

John and Christ preaching the gospel when they ca1ne3 but
they aro obscure to you, both by reason of your voluntary
blindness, who have shut your eyes and your mind against
the saving doctrine of the gospel; and from the just judg-
ment of the Messias, who justly preaohed in clouds and in
covered expressions to them who would not see the sun and
the open light.

ΙΙ. How those words have wracked interpreters, “Is a
candle put under a bushel‚’·' &c.; and, “ There is nothing
hidden,'' &c.: you may see also without a candle. A very
easy sense of them is gathered from the context. When
Christ speaks in parables, “ A light is put under a bushel :⁹³
but “ the light (saith he) is not come for this end‚'’ that it
should be so hidden; nor, indeed, were it fit so to hide it,
but that the divine justice would have it so, that they who
will not see the light should not enjoy the light. But “ there
is nothing hid '' which shall not be made manifest by the
brightness of the doctrine os the gospel, so there be eyes that
do not refuse the light, nor voluntarily become purblind.
Therefore, take you heed how you hear, lest ye be like them,
and divine justice mete to „you by the same measure as is

measured to them3 namely, that they shall never hear, be-
cause they will not hear.

VER. 1 ; Εἰς τὴν χώραν τῶν Γαδαρηνῶν· Into tlte country of
tlte Gadarene] So also Luke: but MattheW‚ εἰς τὴν χώραν
Γεργεσηνῶν, into the country of the Gemesenes. And, which
ought not to be passed over without observation‚ Mark and
Luke, who call it tlze country of tlte Gadarenes, make ment-ion
only of one possessed pe1·son; but Matthew‚ who calls it· the
country of the Geryesenes, speaks of two. We know what is
here said by commentators to reconcile the evangelists. We
fetch their reconciliation from the very distinction of the
words which the evangelists use, and that from those con-
clusions : ’

Ι. We say the region of the Gergesenes was os broader
extent and signification than the region of the Gadarenes
