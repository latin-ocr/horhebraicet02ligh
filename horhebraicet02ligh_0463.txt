Hence appears the reason of those words of the apostle‚
Rom. viii. 15: Ἐλάβετε πνεῦμα υἱοθεσίας, {v ᾧ κράζομεν Ἀββᾶ
ὁ Πατήρ· Y 6 have received tho Spirit of adoption, whoroby wo
cry, Abba, Fatker. And Gal. iv. 6: “Because ye are sons,
God hath sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts,
erying Abba, Fatlzer.” It was one thing to call God ’ΞΝ
Abi, ΡατῘιθν, that is, Lorcl, Isiny, Teaohor, Govamzor, &oq and
another to call him ΝΞΝ Abba, lisy Fatker. The doctrine of
adoption, in the proper sense, was altogether unknown to the
J ewish schools (though they boasted that the people of Israel
alone were adopted by God above all other nations); and yet
they called God ἾΞΝ Faffior, and ἹΞἮΝ our Fatkor, that is,
our God‚ Lord, and King, 850. But “ since ye are sons (saith
the apostle)‚ ye cry, &224 Abba, O my Father,” in the proper
and truly paternal sense.

Thus Christ in this place, however under an unspeakable
agony, and oompassed about on all sides with anguishments‚
and with a very cloudy and darksome providence; yet he ac-
knowledges, invokcs, and finds God ΝΞΝ leis Fatlwr, in a
most swcet sense. Π
