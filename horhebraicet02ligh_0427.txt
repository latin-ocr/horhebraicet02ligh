magic3 which is abundantly asserted not only by the Tal-
mudists, but by the Holy Scriptures3 I ain ready to give
some credit to this story, and many others of the same
nature: namely, that the thing was really acted by the art
and help of the devil by those ensign-bearers and captains of
errors, the more to establish their honour and tradition.

Therefore‚ from the story, be it true or false, we observe
these two things :—

I. How tenacious the Jews were of their traditione, and
how unniovable in them even beyond the evidence of mira-
cles. That Eliezer was of great fame among them, but he
was a follower of Shammai. Hence he is called2 once and
again ἾΠἹὩΨ me Skamwnean. When, therefore, he taught
something against the school of Hillel, although he did mira-
cles (as they themselves relate)7 they gave no credit to him,
nay, they derided him. The same was their practice, the
same was their mind, against the miracles of Christ. And to
this may these words of our Saviour tend, “Why does this
generation seek a sign 2²⁵ a generatim, which is not only alto-
gether unworthy of miracles, but also which is sworn to retain
their traditions and doctrines, although infinite miracles be
done to the contrary.

ΙΙ. You see how the last testimony of the miracles of this
conjuror is fetched from heaven: ‘¹ For the Bath Kol went
forth,⁹' &o. Which the followers of Hillel nevertheless received
not: and therein not justly indeed3 when they feign such a
voice to have come to themselves from heaven, as a definitive
oracle for the authority of the school of Hillel, not to be gain-
said: concerning which the Talmudists speak very frequently,
and very boastingly.

After the same manner they require a sign from heaven of
our Saviour3 not content with those infinite miracles that
he had done, the healing of diseases‚ the casting out devils,
the multiplying of loavesa, &a They would also have
somewhat from heaven, either after the example of Moses
fetching manna from thence3 or of Elias fetching down fire3
