which he was not wont to see, nor concerning which he ever
thought.”

In like manner R. Sheshith answered R. Amram, disputing
with him and asserting something that was incongruws, in
these words3 “ Perhapsx thou art one of those of Pombe-
ditha, who can make an elephant pass through the eye of a
needle:” that is, as the Aruch interprets it, “who speak
things that are impossible.'’

Ver. 283⁷: ‘Tafis- οἱ ἀκολουθήσαντές μοι, ἐν τῇ παλιγγενεσίᾳ·
Ye that have followed mo, iu tlze regeneret-tion] That the world
is to be renewed at the coming of the Messias, and the
preaching of the gospel, the Scriptures assert, and the -Jews
believe; but in a grosser sense, which we observe at chap.
xxiv. Our Saviour, therefore, by the word παλιγγενεσία,
reyeneratt'om calls back the mind of the disciples to a right

wonder should be translated by the interpreters, Aben Ezra,
R. Samia, and others, as well Jews as Christians, thrones
were cast down. R. Solomon the angar, and others, read
it righter, thrones were set up: where Lyranns thus, “He
saith thrones in the plural number, because not only Christ
shall judge, but the apostles‚ and perfect men, shall assist
him in judgment, sitting upon th-rones.”' The same way very
many interpreters bend the words under our hand& namely,
that the saints shall at the day of judgment sit nith Christ,
and apploxe and applaud his judgment. But, 1, besides that
