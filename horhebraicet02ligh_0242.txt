in Sion for a foundation never to be shaken, and whence it
came to pass that that foundation remained so unshaken3

namely, thence, that he was not a creature, but God himself,
the Son of God.

ΙΙΙ. Thence, therefore, Peter took his surname3 not that
he should be argued to be that roais, but because he was so
much to be employed in building a church upon a rock:
whether it were that church that was to be gathered out of
the Jews, of which he was the chief minister, or that of the
Gentiles (concerning which the discourse here is principally
of ), unto which he made the first entrance by the gospel.

Ver. 19: Καὶ δώσω σοὶ τὰς κλεῖς τῆς βασιλείας τῶν οὐρανῶν·
And I will yive thee the heys qf the kinedom of heaven] That is,
Thou skalt first open the door offaitlc to the Gentiles. He
had said that he would build his church to endure for ever,
against which ‘⁶ the gates of hell should not prevail‚'' which
had prevailed against the Jewish church: “ and to thee,
O Peter (saith he), I will give the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, that thou mayest open a door for the bringing in the
gospel to that church.'' Which was performed by Peter in
that remarkable story concerning Cornelius, Acts x. And Ι
make no doubt that those words of Peter respect these words
of Christ, Acts xv. 73 Ἀφ’ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων ὁ Θεὸς ἐν ἡμῖν ἐξε-
λέξατο διὰ τοῦ στόματός μου ἀκοῦσαι τὰ ἔθνη τὸν λόγον τοῦ εὗ-
αγγελίου, καὶ πιστεῦσαι· A qood while ayo God made choica
among] us, that tlce Gentiles should hear tlze word qf the φθερεῖ by
my mouth, and believe.

Καὶ ὃ ἐὰν δήσῃς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, &c And whatsoever thou skalt
bind on earth, &c. Καὶ ὃ ἐὰν λύσῃς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, &a And what-
soever thou skalt Zoose οη earth, &c.] Ι. We believe the keys
were committed to Peter alone, but the power of binding and
loosing to the other apostles also, chap. xviii. 18.

II It is necessary to suppose that Christ here spake ac-
cording to the common people‚ or he could not be under-
stood without a particular commentary, which is nowhere
to be found.

ΙΙΙ. But now to bind and loose, a very usual phrase in the
J ewish schools‚ was spoken of tleinqs, not of persons5 which is
here also to be observed in the articles ’ὸ and ὅσα. what and
erfllzatsoever, chap. xviii.
