244 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xvii. 10.

Ι. Let David Kimehi first be heard upon those words of
Malachi, “Behold, I send you Elias the prophet :³² “God
(saith he) shall restore the soul of Elias, which ascended of
old into heaven, into a created body, like to his former body ε
for his first body returned to earth when he went up to
heaven, each element to its own element. But when God·
shall bring him to life in the body, he shall send him to Israel
before the day of judgment, which is ‘ the great and terrible
day of the Lord ε’ and he shall admonish both the fathers
and the children together to turn to God5 and they that
turn >shall be delivered from the day of judgment·,’' &c. Con-
sider whither the eye of the disciples looks, in the question
under our hands. Christ had commanded in the verse be-
fore, “Tell the visi0n” of the transfiguration “to no man,
until the Son of man be risen from the dead.'' But now,
although they understood not what the resurrection from the
dead meant, (which Mark intimasses) yet they roundly

hoshaphat, inquired of Elisha the prophet; and there it is
written [2 Kings iii. 11], ‘ This is Elisha the son of Shaphat,
{732 ἾΨζ-κζ wlco poured water upon the hands of Elijah? And
this is* a· sign that Elias was first gone up into heaven in a
whirlwind: because it is not said p'g'l' ‘ who pozcretla water,'
but ‘who pourecl.’ Moreover‚ Elisha departed not from
Elijah from the time that he first waited upon him until
Elias went up. And yet we find that, after the death of
Jehoshaphat, in the days of Ahaziah his son it was written,
‘ And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet.' And
this proves that he then writ and sent it: for if it had been
written before his ascensicn, it would be said, a letter was
found or brought to him, which Elias had left behind him.
And it is without controversy, that he was seen in the days of
