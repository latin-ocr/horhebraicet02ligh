Ver. 9: θΩιταυυόι τῷ υἱῲ Δαβίδ· Hosanna to tlte Son of'
David] Some are at a loss why it is said τῷ υἱῲ, to tlae Son,
and not ὦ υἱὲ, O Son .· wherefore they fiy to Caninius as to an
oracle, who tells us, that those very bundles of boughs are

that had been sung or said were again repeated by the com-
pany: sometimes the bundles of boughs were brandished or
shaken. ‘⁶ But when were the bundles shaken ?'' The rubric
of the Talmud saith g, “At that clause ΗΠ1Ὦ ἹἾἹΠ Give tlwmks
