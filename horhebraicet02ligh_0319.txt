Ver. 12: Ψυγήσεται ἡ ἀγάπη τῶν πολλῶν· The love of many
shall waoe cold.] These words relate to that horrid apostasy
which prevailed everywhere in the J ewish churches that had
received the gospel. See 2 Thess. ii. 3, &c.; Gal. iii. 13
1 Tim. i. 15, Sic.

Ver. 14: Καὶ κηρυχθήσεται τοῦτο τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τῆς βασι-
λείας ἐυ ὅλῃ τῇ οἰκουμένῃ’ And tlc‘z's yospel qf tha kin-adom shall

dered these words, “ when you shall see Jerusalem compassed
about with an army,” &20.
