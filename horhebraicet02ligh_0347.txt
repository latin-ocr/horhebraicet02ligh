that it seemed unfit to some that that should be spent so
unadvisedly upon our Lord which might have been bestowed
much better, and more fitly, upon the poor, how easily might

somewhat to the poor, that he might show his care of the
poor, notwithstanding what he had before said concerning
them, and the waste of the ointment.

Ver. 12: Πρὸς τὸ ἐνταφιάσαι με ἐποίησεν She did it for my
buriab] She had anointed his feet, John xii. 3, out of love,
duty, and honour to him3 but this (which is added over and

to die. Hence her fame shall be celebrated, in all agea for
this her saith, and this expression os it.”

or worth only one penny.” Now 9³30 a selom, in his weight,
weighed three hundred and eighty-four barleyeornsc.

houses at Jerusalem were not to be hired, as we have noted
elsewhere, but during the time of the feast they were of
common rightd.

Ver. 19 : Ἡτοίμασαν τὸ Πάσχα· They made ready the Pass-
