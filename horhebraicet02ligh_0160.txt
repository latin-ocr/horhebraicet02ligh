had delivered this prayer in such plain words in his sermon
upon the mount, this command moreover being added, “After
this manner pray ye,'' it was desired again, that he would
teach them to pray? What ! had they forgotten that prayer
that was given them there? Were they ignorant that it was
given them for a form of prayer, and so to be used? But this
seems rather the cause why they desired a second time a form
of prayer, namely, because they might reckon that first for a
publio form of prayer-3 since this might easily be evinced,
both by the addition of the conclusion so like the public
response in the Temple, and especially by the addition of
Amen used only in public assemblies: therefore, they be-
seech him again, that he would teach them to pray privately ;
and he repeats the same form, but omits the conclusion, and
Amen, which savoured of public use. Therefore you have
in the conclusion a sign of the public use, by the agreement
of it to the response in the Temple3 and of the private, by
the agreement of it to the ejaculation in the phylacterical
prayers. A sign of the public use was in the addition of
Amen,- a sign of the private use was in the absence of it: a
sign of both in the conformity of the whole to the custom
of the nation. Christ taught his disciples to pray‚ as John
had taught his, Luke xi. ι ; John taught his, as the masters
among the Jews had theim, by yielding them a form to be
used by all theirs daily, verbatim, and in temus.
