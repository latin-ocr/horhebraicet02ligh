divers originals.

1. It is no wonder, if that nation abounded beyond mea-
sure with a vagabond, dissolute, and lewd sort of young men;
since, by means of polygamy, and the divorces of their wives
at pleasure, and the nation's unspeakable addictedness to
lasciviousness and whoredoms, there could not but con-
