47 6 Hebrew and Talmuclical [Oh. xvi. 1 3,

And to this the title of the two-and-twentieth Psalin seems
to have respect, Ἷζῖῐζῖζῖ Πῖξζζξΐέἕυ. See also Rev. xxii. 163

“I am the bright and morning star.” And now you may
imagine the women went out of their houses towards the
sepulchre.

ΙΙ. ἶΞζὮῖἳ ΠίῬΞΠ ΓΞ, ἾὋἪῚΥΞ when one may distin-misle,
between purple colom and while. ‘⁶ Fromx what time (lo they
recite their phylacterical prayers in the morning? From that
time, that one may distinguish between purple colour and
white. R. Eliezer saith, Between purple colour and green.''
Before this time was obscurum adhuc cceptce lucis, the obseztrity
of tlze heyam hylan, as Tacitus's expression is y.

III. ΠἾῖῸΠ nmium when tlze east beqins to be’ylzten.

IV. ΠῺΠΠ ΥΠ sam’ise. ‘⁶ Fromz the kind ⁰f the morning]
going forth, until the east begins to lighten; and from the
time the east begins to lighten, until sunrise,'’ &c.

According to these four parts of time, one might not im-
properly suit the four phrases of the evangelists. According
to the first, Matthew's τῇ ἐπιφωσκούσῃ, as it heyam to dawn.
According to the second, J ohn’s πρωὶ· σκοτίας ἔτι οὔσης, early
in the mor-nimy, when ic was yet dark. To the third, Luke's
ὄρθρου βαθέως, very early in the morning. To the fourth,
Mark's λίαν πρωΐ, very early in the morning), and yet ἀνατεί-
λαντος τοῦ ἡλίου, at the rising] <gf tlte sun.

For the women came twice to the sepulchre, as John
teacheth3 by whom the other evangelists are to be explained:
which being well considered, the reconciling them together is
very easy.

Ver. 13: Οὐδὲ ἐκείνοις ἐπίστευσαν· Neitlcer believed they
them] That in the verses immediately going before the dis-
course, the question is of the two disciples going to Emmaus,
is without all controversy: and then how do these things
consist with that relation in Luke, who saith, that· ·‘ they ......
returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together,
and them that were with them, saying‚ The Lord is risen
indeed, and hath appeared to Simon, '⁵ Luke xxiv. 33, 34.
