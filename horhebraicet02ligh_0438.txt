seen. But that which Christ saw with leaves on it, and there-
fore went to it, was a fig tree of an extraordinary kind.

ΙΙΙ. For there was a certain fig tree called rum rm:
Benotk Skuack, which never wanted leaves, and never wanted
figs. For every year it bare fruit, but that fruit came not to
full ripeness before the third year: and such, we suppose, was
this fig tree.

Ver. 16¹³: Καὶ οὐκ ἤφιεν ἵνα τὶς διενέγκῃ σκεῦος διὰ τοῦ ἱεροῦ·
Α ml would not suffer that any maoz should carry any vessel through
the Templa] “ WhatC is the reverence of the Temple? That
none go into the Mountain of the Temple’' [or the Oourt of
the Gentiles] ‘⁶ with his staff, and his shoes, with his purse,
and dust upon his feet: ξ’)ᾪἾἹ &sn-1:5¹7 'ww &³¹:⁴5 and that

The same thing is ordered concerning a synagogue3 yea,
concerning a synagogue that is now laid waste, much more
of one that flourisheth: ‘² Ad synagogue now laid waste,
ΝἿἾὋΞΡ ΓΨἸὩ &³¹2 Zet not men make it a common passaye.'’
Ande “ his disciples asked R. Eleazar Ben Shammua, Whence
hast thou lived so long? He answered, I never made a syna-
gogue a common thoroughfare.”

lt is therefore forbid by the masters, that the court of the
Temple be not made a passage for a shorter way. And was
not this bridle sufficient wherewith all might be kept back
from carrying vessels through the Temple? But the ‘ castle
of Antonia’ joined to the court3 and there were shops in the
Gourt of the Gentiles where many things were sold 3 and that
profane vessels were brought hither is scarcely to be denied.
And these vessels might be said to be carried διὰ τοῦ ἱεροῦ,
throuyk tlte Temple‚· although those that carried them went
not through the whole Temple.
