than, as it is written in Esaias .· 11111 especially when the place
first alleged is not in Esaias, but in another prophet.

ΙΙ. Ι1 was very customary among· the Jews (to whose
custom in this matter it is very probable the apostles con-
formed themselves in their sermons) to hear many testimo-
nies cited out of many prophets under this form of speech,
cmm: nim: as it is written in the prophets. If one only
were cited, if two, if more, this was the most common man-
ner of citing them, as it is written in the propheta But
it is without all example, when two testimonies are taken
out of two prophets, to name only the last, which is done
here, if it were to be read, as it is written iri Esaias the
prophet.

III. It is clear enough, from the scope of the evangelist,

the authority of copies, and Irenaeus so citing it, there is
a manifest agreement of the ancient interpretem, the Syriae,
the Latin, the Arabic.” True 0, indeed3 nor can it be de-
nied that very many of the ancients so read: but the an-
cients read also, as it is written in the propliets. One
Arabic copy hath, in Isaiala ilie prophet .· but another
hath, in ilie propliets. Irenaeus once reads in Isaiali .·
but reads twice, in the prophetsd. And “so we find it
written‚” saith the famous Beza (who yet follows the other
reading), “in all our ancient copies except two, and that
