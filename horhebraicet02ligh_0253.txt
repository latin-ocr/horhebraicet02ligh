στάσεως πάυτωυ, times of restitution of all clamys, determined by
God, Acts iii. 21 ; wherein all things were to be framed into

was to be founded, and the doctrine of the gospel dispersed‚
the hearts of the fathers, the Jews, to be united to the sons,
the Gentiles3 and the hearts of the sons, the Gentiles, to the
fathers the Jews: which work was begun by the Baptist‚
and finished by Christ and the apostles. Which term of the
restitution of all these expiring, the commonwealth of the
Jews expired also3 and the gifts of revelation and miracles
granted for this purpose, and so necessary to it, failed.

in that place of the Acts now cited, “ yet God shall still send
you Jesus Christ in the preaching of the gospel to fulfil
these things. Him‚ indeed, as to his person the heavens do
contain, and shall commin, until all these things be perfected3
expect not, therefore, with the erring nation, his personal
presence always on earth: but he shall make up and eonsti-
tute all things by us his ministers‚ until the times deter-
mined and prefixed for the perfecting of this restitution shall
come.''
