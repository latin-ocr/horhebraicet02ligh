phus. Of whose sect, if you should say this Simon was before
his conversion, perhaps you would do him no more wrong
than you would do his brother Matthew, when you should say
that he was a publicam.

Ἰσκαριώτης· Iscariot] It may be inquired whether this
name was given him while he was alive, or not till aster his
death. If while he was alive, one may not improperly derive
it from ΝἾΔἻἾΡΟ Skorifja, which is written also, ΝἾΖΩἾἾΠΙΞΝ
Islsortjat .· where, while the discourse is of a man vowing that
he would not use this or that garment‚ we are taught these
things3 “ He that ties himself by a vow of not using gar-
ments, may use sackcloth‚ veiling cloth, hair eloth, &c but he
may not use “ui wmnwpom N'PDLW &WDDJ' Of which
words the Gloss writes thus ; ‘⁶ These are garments‚ some, of
of leather, and some of a certain kind of clothing.” The
Gemara asketh, ‘⁶ What is wambe& Iskoraegja? Bar Bar
Channah answered, &³327 ΝΠἾΠὉ Α tanner's yarmem.’'
The Gloss is, “A leathern apron that tanners put on over
their clothes.'’ So that Judas Isearz'ot may perhaps signify
as much as Judas with the apron. But now in such aprons
they had purses sewn, in which they were wont to carry their
money, as you may see in Amch, in the words rrum& and
‘VD-m, which we shall also observe presently. And hence,
it may be, J udas had that title of tlce punse-bearem as he was

called Judas with the apron.
Or what if he used the art of a tanner before he was

chose into discipleship? Certainly we read of one Simon a
tanner‚ Acts ix, 433 and that this J udas was the son of Simon,
John xii. 4.

But. if he Were not branded with this title till after his
death, I should suppose it derived from &WDDN Ιεσανας
which word what it signifies, let the Gemarists speak:
“ Nineu hundred and three kinds of death were created in

the world, as it is said, ,ΠἾΝΞΞἽΠ ΠἾῙὲζΞἹ ancl the issaes of

death, Psalm lxviii. 21. The word nimpe· issues arithme-
tically ariseth to that number. Among all those kinds,
ΝἾΞΟΝ Iscara is the, roughest death, ΠρἾζΠΧ is easiest.''
