had another; perhaps that which is now called by us the
Samaritan, which it may be the sons of Ham the Oanaanites
used.

III. That the law was given by Moses in Assyrian letters,
is the opinion (as you see) of some Talmudists; and that, in-
deed, the sounder by much. For to think that the divine
law was writ in characters proper to the cursed seed of Ham,
is agreeable neit-her to the dignity of the law, nor indeed to
reason itself. They that assert the mother-writing was
Assyrian, do indeed confess that the characters of 1116 law
were changed 3 but this was done by reason of 1116 6111 of the
people‚ and through negligence. For when under 1116 first
Temple 1116 Israelites degenerated into Canaanitish manners,
perhaps they used the letters of the Canaanites, which were
the same with those of the inhabitants beyond Euphrates.
These words of theirs put the matter out of doubt: “ The
law was given to Israel in the Assyrian writing in the days
of Moses: but when they sinned under the first Temple
and contemned the law, it was changed into breaking 10
them.'’

Therefore, according to 111666 111611”6 opinion, the Assyrian
writing was the original of the law, and endured and obtained
unto the degenerate age under the first Temple. Then they
think it was changed into the writing used beyond Euphrates
or the Samaritam or, if you will, the Canaanitish (if so be
these were not one and the same); but by Ezra it was at last
restored into the original Assyrian.

Truly, I wonder that learned men should attribute so
much 10 this tradit-ion (for whence else they have received
their opinion, I do not understand), that they should think
that the primitive writing of the law was in Samaritan:
seeing that which the Gemarists assert concerning the
changing of the characters rests upon so brittle and totter-
ing a foundation, that it is much more probable that there
was no change at all (but that the law was first writ in Assy-
rian by Moses, and in the Assyrian also by Ezra), because
the change cannot be built and established upon stronger
arguments.

A second question might follow concerning Keri and Kethib:
and a suspicion might also arise, that the text of the law was
