352 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Ch. xxvi. 27.

These things being thus premised‚ concerning the paschal
wine, we now return to observe this cup of our Saviour.

After those things which used to be performed in the
paschal supper, as is before related, these are moreover
added by Maimonides ε “ Then he washeth his hands, *15:725
ἷἿῖζδΠ ,ΓὉἾΞ and blessetk the blessiny of tlze meaff' [that is,
gives thanks after meat]‚ “over the third cup of wine, and
drinks it up.'' That cup was commonly called ΠΣἾΞΠ ΒὉ
the cup of Messinm &31:527 &0:2⁴2 in the Talmudic dialect.
zum-5 mna ΠΒἾΞ ³712> tn: The cap ofblessz'ozy is when they yive
thanks after supper, saith the Gloss on Babyl. Reman Where
also in the text many things are mentioned of this cup:
“ Ten things are spoken of the ουρ of blessing- ΠΠἾΠ
ΠΞἺΔΨἹ Waslziozy ancl cleansz'ny .·'' [that is, to wash the
inside and outside, namely‚ that nothing should remain of
the wine of the former cups]. ’Π “ Let pure wine '' be poured
into the ουρ, and water mingled with it there. &hm “ Let
it be full: ἾἿῐΟἾ) the crowniny 5³⁶ that is, as the Gemma, “ by
the disciples.’' While he is doing this, let the disciples
stand about him in a crown or ring. ‘'W-0⁸3> The veilin9;
that is, “ as Rabh Papa, he veils himself and sits down;
as R. Issai, he spreads a handkerchief on his head. '³³7me
³³7* ἾἾῙΠΞ He takes up the cup in both hands, but puts it
into his right hand; he lifts it from the table, fixeth his
eyes upon it, &c. Some say he imparts it (as a gift) to his
family.'’

Which of these rites our Saviour made use of, we do not
inquire3 the cup certainly was the same with the “ cup of
blessing :⁵³ nalnely, when, according to the custom, after
having eaten the farewell mox-sel of the lamb, there was now
an end of supper, and thanks were to be given over the third
cup after meat, he takes that cup, and after having returned
thanks‚ as is pmbable, for the meat, both according to the
cust0m‚ and his office, he instituted this for a cup of
eucharist or thanksgiving; Τὸ ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας ὃ εὐλο-
γοῦμεν, The cup of blessinf] which we bless, 1 Cor. x. 16.
Hence it is that Luke and Paul say that he took the cup
“ after supper ;” that is, that cup which closed up the
supper.
