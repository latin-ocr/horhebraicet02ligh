The use of such an interpreter, they think, was drawn
down to them from the times of Ezra, and not without good

reason. 'm δῖἾΡ73Π Πῑ ΠᾏἿΠ ἾῼᾩΞ ἾξνξἾΓῆἾζ Amlo they

Also on the sabbath at the time of the sacrifice. He ap-
pointed washing to those that had the gonorrhoea. He ap-
pointed the session of the judges in eities on the sec-ond and
fifth days of the week,'' &o. Hence, perhaps, it will appear

met together in the synagogue.

that they might retain their eolleagues in the synagogue.
And this certainly respected their synagogues at that time,
