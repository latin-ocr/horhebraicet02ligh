474 Hebrew and Talmudieal [Oh. xv. 43.

the day was the preparation of the sabbath following on the
morrOW.

Of that sabbath John saith, which we cannot let pass,
that μεγάλῃ ἢν ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνου τοῦ σαββάτου· that the clay of
that sabbath was a yreat days, chap. xiX. 31. For it was the
day of the people's appearance in the Temple; it was the
day of the offering of the sheaf of firstfruits : and I ask, whe—
ther before that day Ohrist’s persecutors had offered their
Ohayiyaks?

Ver. 43: Εὐσχήμωυ βουλευτής· An honourable comzsellor]
The Vulgar reads, nobilis decurio, a noble officer: Erasmus,
honestus senator, an laonourable senator .· Beza‚ honoratus
senator, αη honourable senator. The Talmud may serve here
instead of a lexicon.

“ WVas it the ‘¹¹ chamber ΓἾἻἾΠἾΞ προέδρων, qftke okiefmen?
Was it not the chamber *mihin βουλευτῶν, of tlm commel-
Zors? First it was called, 'mwlv'ffl nnwlv the chamber of tlte
counsellors: but· when the high priesthood was bought with

the chief counsellors of the king are yearly changed, thence it
was called ΓἾἾἿΠἾΞ 172le tlte chamber πρόεδ ων, qf proedri,
chief men.'' The Gloss is, ΒἿἾΚΖ] 371le 'm'l'l Ὁ, βουλευταὶ,
counsellors, denotes princes. True, indeed, and hence ζφζοἸἸ ἹΞ
ΝὊἎΞἹ noble ¹¹ men and common persons are contradistinguished.
But why should one not understand those princes and nobles
in the proper sense of the word βουλευταὶ, that is, counsellors 52

Temple should be called by a Greek name? If that Simeon
be he who met Alexander the Great, which the Talmudists0
suppose, then some reason appears for it; but if not, inquire
