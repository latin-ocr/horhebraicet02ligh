Kilaim (or, of the seeds of dffrewt kinds), and of the seventh
year: where, among other things, we meet with these words3
“ R. Simeon Ben Lachish saith that he is freed [from those
lctws] who sows his seed by the sea, D'lvyD “227 mutan NB?
0³³me Ἕω upon .rocks; skelves, aad rocky places.” These
words are spoken according to the reason and nature of the
land of Israel, which was very rocky3 and yet those places
that were so were not altogether unfit for tillage.

there is very frequent mention in the Talmudists of ,ΠἸΞΠῙῚῸ

Ver. 8: Ἐὃίὸου καρπὸν, ὃ μὲν ἑκατὸν, 850. And brouyletforth,
flacit, some a hundred, 320] These words are spoken according
to the fruitfulness of the land of lsrael; concerning which
the 'l‘almuclists speak much, and hyperbolically enough ε
which nevertheless they confess to be turned long since into
miserable bari-enness3 but are dim-sighted as to the true
‹sans-e of it.

Theys treat of this matter, and various stories are produced,
which you may see: we will only mention these two :—

“ R. Jochanan said, The worst fruit which we eat in our
youth excelled the best which we now eat in our old age:
for in his (lays the world was changed.

formerly yielded a bushel of flour, a bushel oi* meal, a bushel
of bran, and a bushel of course bran, and a bushel of coarser
bran yet, and a bushel of the coarsest bran also : but now one
bushel scarcely comes from one bushel.”

Ver. 13³ Βλέπουτες οὐ βλέπουσι, &a They seeinq see not]
Here you may observe this people to have been given up to a
reprobate mind, and a, spirit of deep sleep, now a great while
