of the elders, to determine of a tradition, to preserve it, and
transmit it to posterity 3 and, these things exeepted‚ you will
scarce observe any thing peculial· to him in judging which
was not common to all the rest. Nothing therefore hindered
but that the high priest and the other priests (while he ex-
celled in quality, and they in number) might promote acts
in the council above the rest, and pursue them with the
greatest vigour; but especially when the business before
them was about the sum of religion, as it was here, and in
the examples alleged of Paul and Stephen. It was lawful
for them, to whose office it peculiarly belonged to take care
of sacred things, to show more officious diligence in matters
where these were concerned than other men, that they might
provide for their fame among men, and the good of their
places. The couneil, indeed, might consist of Israelites
only, without either Levites or priests, in case such could
not be found fit: ‘⁶ Thus r it is commanded that in the great
council there should be Levites and priests3 but is such
are not to be found, and the eouneil consists of other Israel-
ites only, it is lawful.'’ But such a scarcity of priests and
Levites is only supposed, was never found ; they were always
a great part, if not the greatest, of the eouncil. Rabban
Joehanan Ben Zacchai‚ the priest, was either now vice-presi-
dent of the council, or next to him. Priests were every-
where in such esteem with the people and with the counciL
and the dignity and veneration of the high priest was so
great, that it is no wonder if you find him and them al-
ways the chief actors, and the principal part in that great
assembly.

Jesus was in Bethany, ὅσ] Tha-t this supper in Bethany was
the same with that mentioned John xiii, I dare venture to
affirm ; however that be taken by very many for the paschal
supper. Let us examine the matter a little home :

Ι. This supper was before the Passover3 so was that:
that this was, none need doubt-,3 no more may they of the
other, if we consider these things :
