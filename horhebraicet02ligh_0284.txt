plain enough that the figs of that year coming on were not
expected by our Saviour, nor could be expected.

'Phat we may pursue the matter somewhat home, and make
it appear that the text of Mark, as it is commonly read, for
the time offiqs was not yet, is uncorrupted,

Ι. We must first observe what is said about the intercala-
tion of the year: “ They intercalate the year upon three
accounts; for the green year, for the fruit of the tree, and
for Tekuplca Ψ Maimonides is more large; whom see g.
Now if you ask what means the intercalation for the fruit of
the tree, the Gloss answers, ‘⁴ If the fruit be not ripened till
Pentecost is past, they intercalate the year ; because Pente-
cost is the time of bringing the firstfruits: and if at that
time one should not bring them along with him when he
comes to the feast, he would be obliged to make another
journey.’' But now this is not to be understood of all trees,
but of some only, which put forth their fruit about the time
of the Passover, and have them ripe at the feast of Pente-
cost. For thus Maimonides in the place cited: “ If the
council sees that there is not yet any green ear, and that
the fruit of tho trees which used to bud at the feast of the
Passover is not yet budded [mark that, ‘ used to bud'],
moved by these two causes, they intercalate the year.”
Among these the fig-tree can by no means be reckoned:
for since, our Saviour being witness h, the putting forth of
its leaves is a sign that summer is at hand, you could not
expect any ripe figs, nay (according to the Talmudists), not
so much as the putting out of leaves, before the Passover.
WVhen it is before said that Pentecost was the time of bring-
ing the firstfmits, it must not be so understood as if the
firstfruits of all trees were then to be brought, but that
before Pentecost it was not lawful to bring any3 for thus
it is provided for by a plain canon, ‘⁶ The firstfruits are not
to be brought before Pentecost. The inhabitants of mount
Zeboim brought theirs before pentecost, but they did not
receive them of them, because it is said in the law i, ‘ And
