Ch. xxviii. 9.] Eaeercitatae'ons upon Ststsattlww. 377

dom of the Messiah was to begin with the resurrection of the
dead, and the renewing of the world.) Therefore it was very
proper that that day from which Christ's kingdom took its
beginning should pass into the sabbath, rather than the old
sabbath, the memorial of the creation.

III. That old sabbath was not instituted till after the
giving the promise of Christ, Gen. iii. 15 ς and the rest of
Crod on that seventh day was chiefly in having perfected the
new creation in Christ: that also was the sabbatical rest of
Adam. When therefore that was accomplished which was
then promised, namely‚ the bruising of the serpent's head by
the resurrectionZ of Christ, and that was fulfilled which was
typified and represented in the old sabbath, namely‚ the
finishing of a new creation, the sabbath could not but justly
be transferred to that day on which these things were done.

IV. It was necessary that the Christians should have a
sabbath given them distinct from the sabbath of the Jews,
that a Christian might be thereby distinguished from a J ew.
For as the law took great care to provide that a ,J ew might
be distinguished from a heathen; so it was provided by the
gospel with the like care, that partly by the forsaking of those
rites, partly by the bringing in of different manners and ob-
servanceS, a Christian might be distinguished from a Jew.
The law was not more solicitous to mark out and separate a
J ew from a heathen by circumcision than the gospel hath
been that by the same circumcision a Christian should not
Judaize. And the same care it hath deservedly taken about
the sabbath: for since the Jews, among other marks of dis-
tinction, were made of a different colour‚ as it were, from all
nat-iona by their keeping the sabbath, it was necessary, that
by the bringing in of anot-her sabbath (since of necessity a
sabbath must be kept up), that Christians might be of a dif-
ferent colour from the Jews.
