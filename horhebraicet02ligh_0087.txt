suppose him b0rn3 and that John was born about the feast
of the Passover, and at that time began to baptize. For
when Christ lived two-and-thirty years and a half, and died
at the feast of the Passover, you must necessarily reduce
his birth to the month Tisri, and about the time of the feast
of Tabernacles: and when John the Baptist was elder than he
by half a year, you must necessarily suppose him born about
the feast of the Passover. But of these things we have said
something already.

Ver. 17: Καὶ ἰδοὺ, φωνὴ ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν’ Ami behold, a voice
from heaven] Christ was honoured with a threefold testimony,
pronounced by a voice from heaven, according to his threefold
office. See what we say at chap. xvii. 2.

You find not a voice sent from heaven between the giving
of the law and -the baptism of Christ. What things the Jews

But why, I pray, was prophecy withdrawn, if heavenly
oracles were to be continued? Why, also, was Urim and
Thummim taken away? Or rather, why was it not restored
after the Babylonian captivity3 For “ Five things (say they ⁰)
were wanting under the second Templed, which were under
the first; namely, the fire from heaven, the ark‚ Urim and
Thummim, the oil of anointing, and the Holy Spirit.” It
would certainly be a wonder, if God, taking away from his
people his ordinary oracles, should bestow upon them a
nobler oracle, or as noble; and that when the nation had
degenerated, and were sunk into all kind of impiety, supersti-
