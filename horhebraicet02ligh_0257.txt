gone, and the feast of Tabernacles at hand. It may be an-
swcred, 1. That Matthew, who recites this story, observed
not the course and order of time, which was not unusual with
him, as being he among all the evangelists that most dis-
joints the times of the stories. But let it be granted that
the order of the history in him is right and proper here, it is
answered, 2. Either Christ was scarcely present at the Pass-
over last past; or if he were present, by reason of the danger
110 was in by the suares of the Jews, he could not perform
this payment in that manner as it ought to have been.
Consider those words which John speaks of the Passover
last past, chap. vi. 4, “ The Passover, a feast of the Jews,
was near;⁵' and chap. vii. 1, “ After these things Jesus
walked in Galilee3 for he would not walk any more 111 Jewry,
because the Jews sought to kill him.'' 3. It was not unusual
10 defer the payment of the half shekels of this year to the
year following, by reason of some urgent necessity. Hence it
was, when they sat to collect and receive this tribute, the
collectors had before them two chests placed3 in one of which
they put the tax of the present year, in the other of the year
paste.

Butf it may bc objected, Why did the collectore of Ca-
pernaum require the payment at that time, when, according
to custom, they began not to demand it before the fifteenth
day of the mouth Adam? I answer‚ 1. It is certain there
were, in every city, moozeyckanyers (ζὌΠίὶἾῖζῖ) to collect it,
and, being collected, to carry it to Jerusalem. Hence is
that in the tract cited, “ The fifteenth day of 1110 month
Adar, the collectors sit inthc cities,'’ 10 demand the half
sheke13 “ and the five-and-twentieth they sit in the Temple.''
2. The uncertain abode of Christ at Oapernaum gave these
&ellectors no unjust cause of demanding this due, when-
soever they had him there present3 at this time especially,
when the feast of Tabernacles was near, and they about to
go to Jerusalem, 10 render an account, perhaPS, of their
collection.

But if any list to understand this of the tax paid the Ro-
mans, we do not contend. And then 1110 words of those
