164 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. viii. 16.

Ver. 16: Ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης· When the even was coma]
Mark adds, ὅτε ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος, when the sun was now set, and
the sabbath was now gone.

I. The sabbath was ended by the Jews at the supper, or
the feast. In which they used a candle (as they did upon
the entrance of the sabbath), and wine, and spices; and the
form of a blessing over a cup of wine, and then over the
candle‚ and then over the spices: “ Does the- sabbath end
when he is now in the middle of his feast? He puts an end
to his eating; washes his hands; and over a cup of wine
he gives thanks for his food; and afterward over that cup
he useth the form of prayer in the separation of the sabbath
frome a common day: if he be now drinking when the sab-
bath goes out, he ceaseth from drinking, and recites the form
of separation, and then returns to his drinkingf.”

ΙΙ. The proper limits of the sabbath were from sun-set to
sun-set. This is sufficiently intimated by St. Mark, when
he saith, that ὅτε ἔδυ ὁ ἥλιος, when tlte sun was now set, they
brought the sick to bc healed: which they held unlawful to
do while the sun was yet going down, and the sabbath yet
present.

The Tahnudic canons give a cantion of some works, that
they be not begun on the day before the sabbath, if they
may not be ended and finished, ΕἸἾ 'tumn while it is yet

was at sun-set, and so was the end of it.

ΙΙΙ. After the setting of sun, a certain space was called
