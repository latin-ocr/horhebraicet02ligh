Ch. ii. 9, Sco] Ewercilatious upon St. Mark. 401

“⁴ He will not forgive your sins ς’ that is, He cannot pardon
your sins3 and then, what advantage is there from him? For
he had not the power of pardoning our sins3 we therefore re-
jected hi1n,’' διο. Ye rejected him, indeed, in whom was
the name of Jehovah; bnt alas! how much to your own
misehief!

Ver. φῖ Τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον εἰπεῖν· ΠἾὶθΐῖισν ‘is it easier to says,
dm] He that observes the use of the word &17³2 it is easy,
and &nvp it is hard, in the -Jewish schools (and, the school-
men were now with Christ), cannot think it improper that
εὐκοπώτερον should be of the same import with NFN, which
word denotes the thing or the sense plain, smooth, and with-
out seruple3 ζψζῃρ it is hard, denotes the contrary. As if
our Saviour had said, ‘⁶ Were not the sense plainer, and more
suited to the present business to have said, ‘ Arise and take
up thy bed‚' than to say, ‘Thy sins are forgiven thee ζ’ But Ι
say thus, that ye may know that the Son of man hath
power‚” &e He does not speak of the easiness of the pro-
nunciation of the words, but of the easiness of the sense.
And I should thus render the words, “ It is easier to say to
the paralytie, Thy sins are forgiven thee, than to say,” &Q
⁴ VVhether to say‚' as it- is vulgarly rendered, hath a sense not
to be disapproved of 3 but, ⁶ than to say,' hath a sense more
emphatical. Is not the sense easier as to the present business
to say, ‘Thy sins are forgiven,q than to say, ‘ Rise up and
walk?

Ver. 12 : Ἐξῆλθευ ἐναντίου πάντων· He went out bejbre them
alh] It is very well rendered, “bcffore them all :¹² and it
might truly be rendered “against them all‚” aeoording to
another signification of the word ἐναντίου. That is, when
the multitude was so crowded that there was no way of
going out through it, he, being not only made whole, but
strong and lusty, pressed through the press of the multitude,
aud stoutly made his way with his bed upon his shoulders.

Ver. 16: Καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν· And sinuare] Who were they?
“ Dicerse, usurers‚ plunderers‚ publicans, shepherds of lesser
cattle, those that sell the fruit of the seventh year-,³³ &o.
