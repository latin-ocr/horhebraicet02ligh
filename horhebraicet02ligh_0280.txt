phecy‚ the occasion of this present action was taken. For
being willing to receive the Messias with all joyfulness, tri-
umph, and affection of mind (for by calling him the Son
of David, it is plain they took him for the Messias), they
had no way to express a more ardent zeal and joy at his
coming, than by the solemn procession of that feast. They
have the Messias before their eyes ; they expect great things
from him3 and are therefore transported with excess of joy
at his coming.

II. But whereas the Great Haud, according to the custom,
was not now sung, by reason of the suddenness of the present
action, the whole solemnity of that song was, as it were,
swallowed up in the frequent crying out and echoing back of
Hosanna‚· as they used to do in the Temple, while they went
round the altar. And one while they sing Hosanna to the Son
of David ,· another while, Hoscmna in the hiylzest,· as if they
had said, “ Now we sing Hosanna to the Son of David ; save
us, we beseeck thee, O thou [who dwellest] in the Mylae-st, save us
by the BIessias.”

τῷ ἱερῷ· He cast out all them that sold ancl bouyht in the
Templa] Ι. There was always a constant market in the
Temple in that place which was called ΠἸἾΠ the slavos,-
where every day was sold wine, salt, oil, and other requisites
to sacrifices ; as also oxen and sheep, in the spacious Oourt
of the Gentiles.

ΙΙ. The nearness of the Passover had made the market
greater; for innumerable beasts being requisite to this so-
lemnity, they were brought hither to be sold. This brings to
mind a story of Bava Ben Buta: “ He⁰ coming one day into
the court found it quite empty of beasts. ‘ Let their houses,'
said he, ‘ be laid waste, who have laid waste the house of our
God.’ He sent for three thousand of the sheep of Kedar3
and having examined whether they were without spot, brought
them into the Mountain of the House ;’' that is, into the Court
of the Gentiles.
