mise. Thus the apostle calls circumcision ‘the seal of the
righteousness of saith ε’ that is, it is the seal of this truth and
doctrine, that ‘justification is by faith,' which righteousness
Abraham had when he was yet uncircumcised. And that is
the way whereby sacraments confirm saith, namely, because
they do doctrinally exhibit the invisible things os the cove-

Christ had commanded to baptize all nations, infants also are
to be taken in as parts of the family, these few things may be
