of a daughter of ’(ἾὮἾἿῙὩΞ Nicodamus Ben θοι-ΞΟΠ, to whom
the wisc men appointed four hundred crowns of gold for a
chest of spices for one day. She said to them, ‘I wish you
may so appoint for their daughters 3' and they answered after
her, ‘ Amen.”' The Gloss is, “ The husband was to give to
his wife ten zuzees for every mamb, which she brought with
her to buy spices, with which she used to wash herself,’' Sco.
Behold! a most wealthy woman of Jerusalem, daughter of
Nicodemus, in the contract and instrument of whose marriage
was written, “ A thousand thousand gold pence out of the
house of her father, besides those she had out of the house
of her father-in-lawff' whom yet you have in the same story

persons in the days of the Messias; which, indeed, when the
true Messias came, proved too, too true, in thy nation.

And now let them tell me, who think that Ohrist indeed
kept his Passover the fourteenth day, but the Jews not
before the fifteenth, because this year their Passover was
transferred unto the fifteenth day by reason of the following
sabbath: let them tell me, I say, whether the evangeliste
