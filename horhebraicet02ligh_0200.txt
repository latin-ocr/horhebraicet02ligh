weeks to Pentecost. For the day of the sheaf and the day
of Pentecost did mutually respect each other. For on this
second day of the Passover‚ the offering of the sheaf was sup-
plicatory, and by way of prayer, beseeching a blessing upon
the new corn, and leave to eat it, and to put in the sickle
into the standing corn. Now the offering of the first fruit
loaves on the day of Pentecost (Lev. xxiii. 15--17) did re-
spect the giving of thanks for the finishing and inning of
barley harvest. Therefore‚ in regat-d of this relation, these
two solemnities were linked together, that both might re-
spect the harvest: that, the harvest beginning; this, the
harvest ended: this depended on that, and was numbered
seven weeks after it. Therefore, the computation of the time
coming between could not but carry with it the memory of
that second day of the Passover-week 3 and hence Pentecost
is called the ‘ Feast of weeks’ (Dent. xvi. 10). The true
calculation of the time between could not otherwise be re-
tained as to sabbaths, but by numbering thus, This is σάβ-
βατον δευτερόπρωτου, tbefirst sabbath after the second day of tbe
Passover. This is δευτεροδεύτερον, the second sabbath after that
second day. And so of the rest. In the Jerusalem Talmud Ζ,
the word &nnuman 17:12] tlte sabbath προτογαμίας, qf tbe
first marriaye, is a composition not very unlike.

W hen they numbered by days, and not by weeks, the
calculation began on the day of the sheaf : ‘¹ A a great num—
ber of certain scholars died between the Passover and Pen-
tecost, by reason of mutual respect not given to one an-
other. There is a place where it is said that they died fif-
teen days before pentecost, that is, thirty-three days after
the sheaf.''

At the end of the Midrash of Samuel which I have, it is
thus concluded; “ This work was finished the three-and-
thirtieth day aster the sheaf.'’

ΙΙΙ. Therefore by this word δευτεροπρώτῳ, the second-first,
added by St. Luke, is shown, first, that this first sabbath
was after the second days of ibe Passover; and so, according
to the order of evangelie history, either that very sabbath
wherein the paralytic man was healed at the pool of Be-
