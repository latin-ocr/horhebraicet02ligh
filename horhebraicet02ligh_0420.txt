Πέζῦρ rm the lesser. The former title you may well bestow

upon this woman, who had laboured under a flux for twelve
years.

Ver. 41: Ταλιθᾶ, κοῦμι· Talitlza humi] “ Rabbi J ochanan
saithss, &Vc remember when ἉΠἾἿῙἎΞἸ &³422 firm: boys
and yirls of sixteen and seventeen years old played in the
streets, and nobody was offended with them.'’ Where the
Gloss is, ΝΠἯῙἊΩἹ &vano Tali ancl Talitka is α boy and α
yirl.

Τὸ κοράσιον, [σοὶ λέγω,] ἔγειραι· Bam-sel, I say emto thee,
arisa] Talitka humi signifies only Τὸ κοράσιον, ἔγειραι·
Mam, arise. How comes that clause then, I say anto thee, to
be inserted?

I. You may recollect here, and perhaps not without profit,
that which was alleged before; namely, that it was customary
among the J eWS, that, when they applied physic to the pro-
fluvious woman, they said, ‘⁶ Arise from thy flux 3⁹² which very
probably they used in other diseases alsa

II. Christt said nothing else than what sounded all one
with, Maid, arise: but in the pronouncing and uttering
those words that authority and commanding power shined
forth, that they sounded no less than if he had said, “ Mam,
I say to thee, or I command thee, arise.” They said, “Arise
from thy disease;'' that is, “ I wish thou wouldst arise:'’
but Christ saith, Maiel, arise,· that is, “I command thee,
arise.’'

Ver. 43: Εἶπε δοθῆναι αὐτῇ φαγεῖν· He commanded that
somethinq should be yivezz laer to eat] Not as she was alive only,
and now in good heasth, but as she was in a most perfect
state of health, and hungry: ‘¹ The son of Rabban Gamaliel
was sick. He sent, therefore, two scholars of the wise men
to R. Chaninah Ben Dusa into his city. He saith to them,
‘Wait for me, until I go up into the upper chamber.' He
went up into the upper chamber, and came down again, and
said, ‘I am sure that the son of Rabban Gamaliel is freed
from his disease.’ The same hour he asked for food.'’
