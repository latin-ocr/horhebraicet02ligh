196 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. xii. Ι.

(the sheaf being then offered) barley-harvest took its be-
ginning.

2. But if, when the just time of the Passover was come,
the barley were not ripe, the intercalary month was added
to that year, and they waited until it ripened: “ For f, for
three things they intercalated the year3 for the equinox, for
the new corn, and for the fruit of the trees. For the elders
of the Sanhedrim do compute and observe if the vernal
equinox will fall out on the sixteenth day of the month Ni-
san, or beyond that 3 then they intercalate that year, and
they make that Nisan the second Adar; so that the Pass-
over might happen at the time of new corn. Or if they ob-
serve that there is no new corn, and that the trees sprouted
not when they were wont to sprout, then they intercalate the
year,’' διο.

You have an example of this thing: “ Rabbang Gamaliel
to the elders of the great Sanhedrim, our brethren in J udea
and Galilee, ὤας health. Be it known unto you, that since
the lambs are too young, and the doves are not fledged, and
there is no young corn, we have thought good to add thirty
days to this year‚'’ &c.

Οἱ δὲ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπείνασαν· And his discv‘ples were an
hun-qred] The eustom of the nation, as yet, had held them
fasting3 which suffered none, unless he were sich, to taste
any thing on the sabbath before the morning prayers of the
synagogue were done. And on common days also, and that
in the afternoon, provision was made by the canons, “ Thath
none, returning home from his work in the evening, either
eat, or drink, or sleep‚ before he had said his prayers in the
synagogue.''

Of the public or private ways that lay by the corn-fields‚
let him that is at‘leisure read Peah‚ ehap. ii.

Ver. 2: Ποιοῦσιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστι ποιεῖν ἐν σαββάτῳ· They do
that which is not lawficl to do οη the sabbath day] They do
not eontend about the thing itself, because it was lawful,
Deut. xxiii. 2 53 but about the thing done on the sabbath.
