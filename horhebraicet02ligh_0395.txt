thy king, and, even from this one example, learn what a prince
thou hast to boast of. The royal father of his country received my
supplication cheerfully, complied with my desires, and granted me
his donation,—established it with his great seal, and (which I desire
might be written in letters of gold to last for ever) by a particular,
and, as it were, paternal care, took order that hereafter none, by any
means whatsoever, should proceed to do any thing that tended either
to my danger or ruin.

O ἕ how would I commemorate thee, thou best of princes, greatest
Charles, how would Ι commemorate thee l What praises or what ex-
pressions shall Iuse to celebrate or set forth so great clemency, com-
miseration, and goodness'l Those are light obligations that speak,
these my obligations stand amazed, are speechless, and swallowed
up in admiration. It is for common men to do benefits that may
be expressed in words, it is for Charles to oblige beyond all that
can be spoken.

Ι will add another thing also, O stranger, which the same mercy
and goodness also added. For when Ι feared the same fortune in

I obtained his grant, confirmed by his hand, and the great seal of
England. And thus rooted out here he replanted me 3 and ready
to be rooted out elsewhere he preserved me, rescued me from
danger, freed me of my sear ε so that now I, as well as my
worthy predecessors, have this to boast of, that Ι have a king to
my patron.

But far be it, far be it, from me, most unworthy man, to boast :
all this, most great, most merciful prince, redounds to your praise
alone 3 and let it do so : rather let England glory in such a prince,
and let the prince glory in such mercy. Triumph, Caesar, triumph
in that brave spirit of yours, as you well may. You are Charles,
and you conquer, you subdue all by pitying, delivering, giving, and
forgiving all.

That conquest I shall always acknowledge with all humility and
thankfulness : and thou, little book, and you, trifling sheets, where-
