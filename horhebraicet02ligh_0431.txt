Oh. ix. 43, 49. Exercitations upon St. Mar-k. 4925
That, John xvi. 24, “ Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my

· name,” differs not much from this sense: ‘ The apostlcs

poured out their prayers, and all the holy men theirs, in tho
name of the Messias3 but- ye have as yet asked nothing in
my name Jesu3‚’ &e

Ver. 43: Ἀπόκοψου αὐτήν· Out it offss] ‘⁶ Rabh Monae, in
the name of R.Juda11‚ saith, A drop of cold water in the
morning [applied to the eye]‚ and the washing of the hands
and feet in the evening, ’0¹75wa ΓἾἾῖὮὮ &Dm is qood beyond
all the collyrium [eye-salve] in the whole world. For he said,
9217ss 3³37ss “1³ The hand applied to the eye [in the morning),
before waslainq] let it be cut offi The hand applied to the
nostril, let it be cut off : the hand put to the ear, let it be
cut off,” 850.

Ver. 49: Πᾶς γὰρ πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται· For every one shall be
salted with fira] The great Scaliger is well chastised‚ and
not without cause, by John Oloppenberg f, because he changed
the reading here into πᾶσα πυρία ἁλισθήσεται, every sacrifice
shall be salted. See what he saith.

Πᾶς, all, is not to be understood of every man, but os
every one of them ‘⁶ whose worm dieth not‚'' &e

The sense of the place is to be fetched from those words,
and the sense of those words from Isa. lxvi. 24 : “ And they
shall go forth, and look upon the cal-cases of the men that
have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die,
neither shall their fire be quenched 3 and they shall be an
abhorring unto all flesh.” Upon which place thus the Jews
write3 “‘They shall go forth and look,' &a Is not the
finger of a man, if it be put into the fire, immediately but-nt?
But eod gives power (or beiny) to wicked men to receiveg
torments.'' Kimchi upon the place thus: “They shall sec
the carcases of them full of worms, and fire burning in then1:'’
and yet the worms die not.

The words therefore of our Saviour respect this: ‘⁶ Their
worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched 3 for every one
of them shall be seasoned with fire itself, so as to become
unconsumable, and shall endure for ever to be tormented, as
salt preserves from corruption.
