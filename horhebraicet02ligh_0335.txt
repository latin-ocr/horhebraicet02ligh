dent of the council, was taken and killed in the siege of the
city; and Rabban J ochanan hise vice-president was very near
it, both of them being drawn from J afne to the city, with the
rest of the bench, for observation of the Passover.

Whether the hall of the high priest were the ordinary
receptacle for the council, or only in the present occasion,
we do not here inquire. It is more material to inquire con-
cerning the bench itself, and who sat president in judging.
The president of the council at this time was Rabban Gama-
liel, (Paul's masten) and the vice—president, Rabban Simeon
his son, or Rabban Jochanan Ben Zaccai (which we do not
dispute now). Whence therefore had the chief priest, here
and in other places, 1116 precedence and the chief voice in
judging? For thus in Stephen's case the high priest is the
chief of the inquisition, Acts vii. 1 3 also in Paul's case, Acts
xxiii. 2, see also Acts ix. 1. Had the priests 6 601111611 and
judgment seat of their own? or might they in the chief council,
when the president was absent, hear causes of life and death?
To this long question, and that enough perplexed, we reply
these few things:

I. We confess, indeed, that the priests had a bench and
council of their own, yet denying that there was a double
council, one for ecclesiastical, the other for civil affairs, as
some would have it.

We meet oft-en with mention of the chamber qs the coun-
