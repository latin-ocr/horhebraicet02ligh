Oh. xvi. 13] Issrercitat‘e‘uns upon. St. Mark. 477

The word λέγοντας, samin-a, evidently makes those to be the
words τῶν ἕνδεκα, os tlce elevem, and of those that were gathered
together with them: which, when you read the versions‚ you
would scarcely suspect. For when that word is rendered by
the Syriae ΓἾῩΞΝ Ὃς by the Arabio ᾏἾῘΊᾩἾ DUM by the
Vulgar dicentes,· by the Italian dicendo‚· by the French
disans: by the English sayin9; who, 1 pray, would take it
in another sense than that those two that returned from
Emmaus said, “ The Lord is risen indeed,’' &0sp But in the
original Greek, since it is the accusative case, it is plainly to
be referred to the eleven disciples‚ and those that were
together with them. As if they had discourse among them-
selves of the appearance made to Peter, either before, or now
in the very access of those two coming from Emmaus. And
yet saith this our evangelist, that when those two had related
the whole businessa, they gave credit no not to them. So
that according to Luke they believed Christ was risen and
had appeared to Simon, before they told their story; but
according to Mark, they believed it not, no not when they
had told it.

'Phe reconciling‚ therefore, of 1116 evangelists, is to be fetched
thence, that those words pronounced by the eleven,‘'O·n ἠγέρθη
ὁ Κύριος ὅντως, &c., Tlae Lord is risen indeed, &c., (10111 1101
manifest their absolute confession of the resurrection of Christ,
but a conjectural reason of the sudden and unexpected return
of Peter.

I believe that Peter was going with Cleophas into Galilee,
and that being moved with the words of Christ told him by
the women, “ Say 10 1115 disciples and Peter, I go before you
into Galilee.” Think with yourself, how doubtful Peter was,
and how he fluctuated within himself after his threefold de-
nial; and how he gasped to see the Lord again, if he were
risen, and to 61151 himself an humble supplicant at his feet.
When, therefore, he heard these things from the women (and
he had heard it indeed from Christb himself, while he was yet
alive, that “ when he arose he would go before them into
Galilee'')‚ and when the rest were very little moved with the
report of his resurrection, 1101· as yet stirred from that place,
