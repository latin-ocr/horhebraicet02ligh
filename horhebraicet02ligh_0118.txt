112 Hebraeo and Talmudical [Ch. v. 22.

nn: ΞἯΠ Ἶ“’ἲῖ> “ Iflce shall do this out of pre-sumptim, he is
quilty of cutting) off& but if he shall do it out of ignorance, he
is bound for a sacrifice for sin.” When they adjudge a thing
or a guilty person to cutting off, they deliver and leave him
to the judgment of God3 nevertheless, a censure and punish-
ment from the Sanhedrim sometimes is added, and some-
times not. Which might be illustrated by infinite examples,
but we are afraid of being tedious. Let these two be enough
on both sides.

I. Of mere delivering over to the jndgment of God, with-
out any punishment inflicted by the Sanhedrim, those words
speak, which were lately cited, “ He is absolved from the
judgment of men, but liable to the judgment of Heaven.’'

II. Of the judgment of God and of the Sanhedrim joined
together, these words in the same place speak: “If he that
is made guilty by the Sanhedrinl be bound to make restitu-
tion, Heaven [or Gocl] doth not pardon him until he pay it.”
But he that bears a punishment laid on him by the Sanhe-
drim is absolved from cutting off. “Allc persons guilty of
cutting off, when they are beaten are absolved from their

cutting off: as it is said, ‘ And thy brother become vile in
thy sight) XVhen he shall be beaten, behold, he is thy
brother.''

’Ένοχος εἷς γέενναν τοῦ πυρὸς, Liable ον· ,quilty even to Hae
hellfire. He had said κρίσει, guilty of judfyment, and συνεδρίῳ,
of the councz'l, before 3 but now he saith εἰς γέενναν, mzto hell,
and that in a higher emphasis3 as if he should have said,
“ Whosoever shall say to his brother, Μωρὲ, Fool, shall be
guilty of judgment, even unto tlzejudyment of hell.”

But what was there more grievous in the word fool, than
in the word Roma? Let king Solomon be the interpreter,
who everywhere by a fool understands a wichad and reprobate
person ; foolishness being opposed to spiritual wisdom. Raca
denotes indeed morosity, and Ziqhtness of manners and lzfe:
but fool judgeth bitterly of the spiritual and eternal state,
and decreeth a man to certain destruction. Let the judgings
and. censures of the scribes and Pharisees concerning the com-
mon people serve us instead of a lexicon. They did not onlyd
suffer themselves to be styled ΕᾯΞΒΠ mise men, but also arro-
