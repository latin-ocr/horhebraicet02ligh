together that both retain their force 3 but the former was
partly taken off by the latter, and partly not. The Divine
Wisdom knew that inhuman husbands would use that law of
death unto all manner of cruelty towards their wives: for
how ready was it for a wicked aud unkind husband to lay
suares even for his innocent wife, is he were weary of her,
to oppress her under that law of death! And if she were
taken under guilt, how cruelly and insolently would he tri-
umph over her, poor woman, both to the disgrace of wedlock
and to the scandal of religion ἔ T herefore the most prudent,
and withal merciful lawgiver, made provision that the woman,
if she were guilty, might not go without her punishment3
and if she were not guilty, might go without danger3 and
that the wicked husband that was impatient of wedlock
might not satiate his cruelty. That which is said by one
does not please me, “That there was no place for divorce
where matrimony was broke off by capital punishment 3⁵³ for
there was place for divorce for that end, that there might not
be place for capital punishment. That law indeed of death
held the adulterer in a snare, and exacted capital punishment
upon him, and so the law made sufficient provision for
terror: but it consulted more gently for the woman, the
weaker vesseL lest the cruelty of her husband might unmer-
cifully triumph over her.

Therefore‚ in the suspicion of adultery, and the thing not
discovered, the husband might, if he would, try his wife by
the bitter waters; or if he would, he might connive at her.
In case of the discovery of adultery, the husband might put
away his wife, but he scarce might put her to death 3 because
the law of divorce was given for that very end, that provision

might be made for the woman against the hardheartedness
of her husband.

Let this story serve for a conclusion; “ Shemaiaho and
Abtalion compelled Carchemith, a libertine woman-servant,
to drink the bitter waters.'’ The husband of this woman
could not put her away by the law of Moses, because she was
not found guilty of discovered adultery. He might put her
away by the traditional laW, which permitted divorces without
