inhumanity of husbands towards their wives: but this is to
be understood also under restriction: for Moses permitted
not divorces, because, simply and generally men were severe
and unkind towards their wives; for then, why should he
restrain divorces to the cause of adultery ἓ but because, from
their fierceness and cruelty towards their wives, they might
take hold of and seek occasions from that law which punished
adultery with death, to prosecute their wives with all manner
of severity, to oppress them, to kill them.

Letl us search into the divine laws in case of adultery a
little more largely.

1. There was a law made upon the suspicion of adultery,
that the wife should undergo a trial by the bitter waters,
Num. v: but it is disputed by the Jewish schools, rightly
and upon good ground, whether the husband was bound in
this case by duty to prosecute his wife to extremity, or
whether it were lawful for him to connive at and pardon her,
if he would. And there are some who say ΠΞἸΠ, that is, he
was bound by duty; and there are others who say ΠἾῙΠἾ
that it was left to his pleasarem.

2. There was a law of death made in case of the discovery
of adultery, Deut. xxii. 21—23: “ If a man shall be found
lying with a married woman, both shall die,” &a Not that
this law was not in force unless they were taken in the very
act; but the word &373³ shall be found, is opposed to sus-
picion, and means the same as if it were said, “ When it shall
be found that a man hath lain,'' &c.

3. A law of divorce also was given in case of adultery
discovered, Deut. xxiv. 1 3 for in that case only, and when it
is discovered, it plainly appears from our Saviour's gloss, and
from the concession of some Rabbins also, that divorces took
place: for, say they in the place last cited, ‘⁶ Does a man find

something foul in his wife? he cannot put her away, &3127
εΠἾἾΏ ΠΕ &BD because he laath not found foul nakedness in

her ,·'' that is, adultery.
Butn nOW, how do the law of death and that of divorce
consist together? It is answered, They do not so consist
