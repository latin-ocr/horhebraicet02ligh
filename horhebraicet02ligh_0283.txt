Ch. xxi. ¹9·] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 277

Ver. 19 : Οὐδὲν εὗρεν ἐι) αὐτῇ εἶ μὴ φύλλα μόνου· Found
nothing] tkereon but leaves only] This place is not a little
obscure, being compared with Mark xi. 13, who seems to say,
that therefore figs were not found on this tree, because it was
not yet the time offiys, οὗ γὰρ ἢυ καιρὸς σύκων. Why then did
our Saviour expect figs, when he might certainly know that
it was not yet the time of fiys ? And why, not finding them,
did he curse the tree, being innocent and agreeable to its own
nature?

Ι. We will first consider the situation of this tree. Our
evangelist saith, that it was in the way, ἐπὶ τῆς ὁδοῦ. This
minds me of a distinction used very often by the Talmudists,
betweenb ἾΡΞἸῺ and ἾἸΌΨ that is, between the fruits of trees
of common right, which did not belong to any peculiar master,
but grew in woody places, or in common fields 3 and the fruits
of trees which grew in gar-dens, orchards, or fieldS, that had a
proper owner. How much difference was made between these
fruits by the canonistS, as to tithing, and as to eating, is in
many places to be met with through the whole classeS, entitled.
ΠΨἾτ Seeds. This fig-tree seems to have been of the former
kind: maz-m russi a wilci fiy-tree, ἾρΞΠΞ growing in a
place or field, not belonging to any one in particular, but
common to all. So that our Saviour did not injure any parti-
cular person, when he caused this tree to wither 3 but it was
such a tree, that it could not be said of it, that it was mine or
thina.

ΙΙ. He found nothinq thereon but leaves, because the time of
figs was not yet a great while, Mark xi. 13.

1. “ Atc what time in the seventh year do they forbear to
lop their trees? The school of Shammai saith, nubum ³7:
ἾΝἾΕἸἾΨὮ All trees from that time, they brinqfhrtlz [leaves]. The
Gloss, ‘⁶ The beginning of leaves is in the days of N isan.”

2. “ Rabband Simeone Ben Gamaliel saith, From the put-
ting forth of leaves, till there be green figs, is fifty days, from
the green figs, till the buds fall off, fifty days 3 and from that
time till the figs be ripe are fifty days.” If, therefore, the first
putting out of the leaves was in the month Nisan, and that
was five months' time before the figs came to be ripe, it is
