the Assyriam for xvriting.” What is that which he calls the
mother-tongue? ’11 is very easily answered, the Greek, from
those encomiums added to it, mentio-ned before: and that
may more confidently be affirmed from the words of Midras
Tillinf, respecting this saying of R. J ochanan, and mentioning
the Greek language by name. “ R. Joehanan said, There are
three languages3 the Roman, for war3 the Greek, for speech;
the Assyrian, for prayer.'' To this also belongs that, tha-t
occurs once and again in Bab. Megillahg, ὌἿἾἺ 13719] [η the
Greek mother touque. You have an instance of the thingh:
“ R. Levi, coming to Caesarea, heard some 922⁸& ΓἿἾΡ

This is worthy to be marked. At Caesarea flourished the
famous schools of the Rabbins. ΓἻΒῬἻ ΓΞΞἽ Tlce Rabbms
of Ocesarea are mentioned in both Talmuds most frequently,
and with great praise, but especially in that of Jerusalem.
But yet among these, the Greek is used as the mother-tongue,
and that in reciting the phylacteries, which, you may well
think, above all other things, in Judea were to be said in
Hebrew.

In that very Caesarea, Jerome mentions the Hebrew Gospel
of St. Matthew‚ to be laid up in the library of Pamphilus, in
these words: ‘⁶ Matthew, who was also called Levi, from a
publican made an apostle, first of all in J udea composed the
Gospel of Christ in Hebrew letters andi words, for their sakes‚
who were of the circumcision and believed. Which Gospel,
who he was that afterward translated it into Greek, it is
not sufficiently known. Moreover, that very Hebrew Gospel
is reserved to this day in the librar-y at Gaesarea, which Pam-
philus the martyr, with much care, collected. I also had
leave given me by the Nazarenes‚ who use this book in Berea,
a city of Syria, to write it out.''

It is not at all to be doubted, that this Grospel was found
in Hebrew3 but that which deceived the good man was not
the very hand-writing of Matthew, nor, indeed, did Matthew
write the Grospel in that language: but it was turned by
somebody out of the original Greek 11110 HebreW, that so, is
