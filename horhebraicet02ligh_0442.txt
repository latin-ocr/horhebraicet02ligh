for this distinction they sometimes use. ἺΔἺΕΞ uu, the Gloss

frequently, *³53 :mmm and rui-m ‘vm ymon money of
Tzur, ancl money of Jerusalem. ἿἾἾΕ ymon one may well
render Tyrian money. But hear the Aruelc, where he had
been treating of money ἾἾἾΕ of Tzur ,· at length he brings in
this passage: “ R. Eliezer saith, Wheresoever in the Scrip-
ture 5¹12 Tzur is written full, the Scripture speaks of the
city Tyre: but where it is written defectively [Ἶέζ without Ἰ
(Vau)], it speaks of Rome? Be it Tyrian or Roman money,
this held among the masters: “ Wheresoevers any thing is
said of the silver money 'UT-“5⁵2 ‘7127 of Jerusalem, it is the
eighth part of the Tyrian money.‘''

Hence I should resolve that riddle at which the Glosser
himself sticks, if I may have leave to conjecture in a Jewish
affair, after a doubting J ew. In the tract now citedt there
is a discourse concerning nvmlvw'ffi* ,ΠἾἮῖἾΞ ΓΠὩῸ Jeru-
salem Cozbian moneys. A riddle truly. Ben Cozbi, indeed,
coined moneys when he made an insurrection against the
Romansu. But whence is this called Jerusalem money, when,
in the days of Ben Cozbi, Jerusalem lay buried in its own
rubbish? If I may be the resolver‚ it was so called, because
it was of the same weight and value with the Jerusalem money,
and not with that of Tyre.

“ The Jerusalem money (say they) is the eighth part of the
Tyrian.’' Here again some words of the masters entangle
me in a riddle. The Aruohx saith, “ A penny and zue are the
same.” And elsewhereY, “ They call peuce, in the Gemaristic
language, Zuzim,·” which we observed at chap. vi. ver. 37.
‘ Zuz' was Jerusalem money: how, then, was it the same with
a penny, which was Tyrian money, when it was the eighth
part only? And these words spoken by Rambam² do add
a scruple over and above3 0³3*ss ’Ἰ ἾΞἾἾΠ a penny contains
six zuzim. If a he had said eiykt zuzim, it had been without
scruple. But what shall we say now?

The former knot you may thus untie: that zue, among the
