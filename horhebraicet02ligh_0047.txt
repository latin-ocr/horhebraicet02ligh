U zziel, the Chaldee paraphrast. 6. Simeon, the son of Hillel.

bable the star had shone in the very birthnight: and thence-
forward to this very time it had disappeared. The wise men
had no need os the star to be their guide when they were
going to Jerusalem, a city well known ; but going forward
thence to Beth-lehem, and that, as it seems, by night, it was
their guide.
