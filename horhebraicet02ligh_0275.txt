Ver. 22 : Τὸ βάπτισμα, ὃ ἐγὼ βαπτίζομαι· Tlee baptism
that I am baptized with] The phrase that goes before this,
concerning the cup, is taken from divers places of Scripture,
where sad and grievous things are compared to draughts of
a bitter cup. Y ou may think that ΠἾΞῺἾἾΞ 0Ἶέ the cup qf
venyeanee, of which there is mention in Bab. Beraeoth ¹¹¹,
means the same thing, but it is far otherwise: give me leave
to quote it, though it be somewhat out of our bounds τ “ Let
them not talk (say they) over their cup of blessing3 and let
them not bless over their cup ofvenyecmce. D'llzffi'ffi cn: *24³2
What is the cup of venffeance ,9 The second cup, saith R. Nach-
man Bar Isaac.’' Rabbena Asher and Piske are more clear:
‘⁶ If he shall drink off two cupS‚ let him not bless over the
third.” The Gloss‚ “ He that drinks off double cups is
punishedn by devils.'' But to the matter before us.

So cruel a thing was the baptism of the Jews,‚ being a
plunging of the whole body into water, when it was never so
much chilled with ice and snow, that, not without cause,
partly, by reason of the buryz'ngy as I may call it under water,
and partly by reason of the cold‚ it used to signify the most
cruel kind of death. The Jerusalem Talmudists relate, that
“in the days of J oshua Ben Levi, some endeavoured quite to
take away the washings [wlffinto baptism] of women, because
the women of Galilee grew barren by reason of the coldness
of the waters ;'’ which⁰ we noted before at the sixth verse of
the third chapter.
