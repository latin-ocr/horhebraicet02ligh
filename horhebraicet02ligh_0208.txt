'202 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xii. 20.

not make kim known] But this, not that he refused to heal
the sick, nor only to shun popular applause3 but because he
would keep himself hid from those who would not acknowledge
him. This prohibition tends the same way as his preaching
by parables did, Matt. xiii. 13 3 “ Ι speak to them by parables,
because seeing they see not.” He would not be known by
them who would not know him.

Ver. 20: Κάλαμον συντετριμμένον οὗ κατεάξει· Α brm'sed reed
shall lae not break] These words are to be applied, as appears
by 111080 that went before, to our Saviour's silent transaction
of his own affairs, without hunting after applause, the noise
of boasting, or the loud reports of fame. He shall not make
so great a noise as is made from the breaking of a reed now
already bruised and half broken, or from the hissing of smoking
flax only when water is thrown upon it. How far different is
the Messias thus described, from the Messias of the expecta-
tion of the Jews! And yet it appears sufficiently that Isaiah,
from whom these words are taken, spake of the Messias, and

‘'Ecos ἂν ἐκβάλῃ εἷς νῖκος τὴν κρίσιν· Τίἶί he send forth judy-

words in both places mean thus much, That Christ should

or state, but should manage his affairs in humility‚ silence,
poverty, and patience, both while he himself was on earth,
and by his apostles, after his ascension, labouring under
contempt, poverty, and persecution3 but at last “he should
bring forth judgment to victory ;” that is, that he should
break forth and show himself a judge, avenger‚ and con-
queror, against that most wicked nation of the Jews, from
whom both he and his suffered such things: and then, also,
“ he sent forth judgment unto truth,” and asserted himself
the true Messias, and the Son of God, before the eyes of
alh and confirmed the truth of the gospel, by avenging his
cause upon his 0110111108,111 3 manner so conspicuous and so
dreadful. And hence it is, that that sending forth and exe-
cution of judgment against that nation is almost always
called in the New Testament “ his coming in glory.”' When
Christ and his kingdom had so long lain hid under the veil
