Ch. xviii. 18.] Exercitations upon St, Matthew. 25ss

friendly offices towards heathens and publicans, That of Mai-
monides is not much different: “ ΑΧ Jew that apostatizes,
or breaks the sabbath presumptuously‚ is altogether like a
keatlwn.⁷⁹

1. They reckoned not lammens for brethren or neighbours:
“ Ify any one's ox shall gore his neighbour's ox: his neigh-
bour's, not a kecctloen's .· when he saith neiylcbour'a he excludes
keatheusss’ A quotation which we produced before.

2. They reputed publicans to be by no means within reli-
gious society: mnino-m 'ts-n& ῙἼΠἹἿ ’Nan mmmm *mn ΑΖ
reliyious man, who becomes a publio-an, is to be driven out of the
society qf reliyion.

3. Hence they ate neither with heathens nor with publi-
cans: concerning which thing they often quarrel [with] our
Saviour. Hence that of the apostle, 1 Cor. v. 1 1 3 “With such
an one no not to eat‚” is the same with what is spoke here,
‘⁶ Let him be to thee as a hoamen? 820.

“ Ita is forbidden a ,J ew to be alone with a laeatlten, to travel
with α lammam? &a

4. They denied also brotherly offices to heatkens and publi-
cans: ‘⁶ Itb is forbidden to bring home any thing of a heathen’s
that is lost.” “ {tc is lawful for publicans to swear that is an
oblation which is not3 that you are of the king's retinue when
A you are are not‚'' &c. that is, publicans may deceive, and that
by oath.

Ver. 18: “Ocra ἐὰν δήσητε ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, διο. PVlcatsoever με
shall bina} οη earth, dccx] These words depend upon the former.
He had been speaking concerning being loosed from the office
of a brother in a particular case: now he speaks of the au-
thority and power of the apostles of loosiny and binding] “ any
thing” whatsoever seemed them good, being guided in all
things by the Holy Ghost. We have explained the sense of
this phrase at chap. xvi.; and he gives the same authority in
respect of this, to all the apostles here, as he did to Peter

there; who were all to be partakers of the same Spirit and
of the same gifts.
