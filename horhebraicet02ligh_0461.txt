eat the PassoverZ R. J ochanan in the name of R. Simeon
Ben J osedek saith, The Scripture saith, ‘You shall have a
song, as in the night when a feast is kept,' Isa, xxx, 29. The
night which is set apart for a feast is bound to a hymn .· the
night which is not set apart for a feast is not bound to α
ῘιψηηΡ The Gloss writes thus ; ‘⁶ As ye are wont to sing in
the night when a feast is kept: but there is no night wherein
they are obliged to a song, besides the‘night when the Pass-
over is eaten.''

II. That hymn is called by the Rabbins the Hallel3 and
was from the beginning of Psalm cxiii, to the end of Psalm
cxviii, which they cut in two parts; and a part of it they
repeated in the very middle of the banquet‚ and they reserved
a part to the end.

How far the former portion extended, is disputed between
the schools of Shammai and Hillel. That of Shammai saith,
Unto the end of Psalm cxiii. That of Hillel saith, Unto the
end of Psalm cxiv, But these things must not stop us.
The hymn which Christ now sang with his disciples after
meat was the latter part. In which, as the Masters of the
Traditions observe‚ these five things are mentioned: “The0
going outP of Egypt. The cutting in two of the Red Sea.
The delivery of the law. The resurrection of the dead : and
the sorrows of the Messias. The going out of Egypt, as it
is written, ‘ When Israel went out of Egypt! The cutting
in two of the Red Sea, as it is written, ‘ The sea saw it, and
fied? The delivery of the law, as it is written, The moun-
tains leaped like rams? The resurrection of the dead, as it
is written, ‘I will walk before the Lord in the land of the
living.’ And the sorrows of the Messias, as it is written,
‘ Not unto us, Lord, not unto us.'

Ἐξῆλθον εἷς τὸ ὄρος τῶν ἐλαίων· They went out into the mount
of Olives] They were bound by the traditional canons to
lodge within Jerusalem. ‘⁶ an the first Passover, every one
is bound to Zodqe [pernoctationem] (ΠΞἿῘῬ ῙἹὩὯ) also on the
second Passover he is bound to lodge.'’ The Gloss thus:
“ He that keeps the Passover is bound to lodge in Jerusalem
the first night.’' But it is disputed, whether it be the same
