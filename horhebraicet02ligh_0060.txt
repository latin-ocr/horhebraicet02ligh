54 Hebrew and Talmudz'oal [Oh. iii. 6.

First, seven weeks having been reckoned up before, and
then sixty-two weeks, ver. 2 5,—now there remained one only
of the seventy; and in reference to that, in the middle of it
the Messias shall begin his ministry3 which being finished in
three years and a half (the latter halved part of that week)‚
“ he shall make the sacrifice and oblation to cease,'' &c.

The nation could not but know, could not but take great
notice of, the times so exactly set out by the angel Gabriel.
Since, therefore, the coming of the Messias was the great
wish and desire of all,—and since the time of his appearing
was so clearly decreed by the angel that nothing could be
more,—and when the latter half of the last seven years,
chiefly to be observed, was now, within a very little, come ;-
11 is no wonder if the people, hearing from this venerable
preacher that the kingdom of heaven was now come, should
be stirred up beyond measure to meet him, and should flock
to him. For, as we observed before, ‘⁴ They thought that the
kingdom of Grod would immediately be manifested,'’ Luke
mx. 1 1.

tism, for an evangelica] sacrament, was first in the hand of
the Baptist, who, “the word of the Lord coming to him,'’
(Luke iii. 2,) went forth, backed with the same authority as
the chiefest prophets had in times past. But yet the first use
of baptism was not exhibited at that time. For baptism,
very many centuries of years backwards, had been both
known and received in most frequent use among the Jews,
—and for the very same end as it now obtains among Christ-
ians,—namely, that by it proselytos might be admitted into
the church3 and hence it was called ΓΠἾἎ Πιρῂτῡ Baptism
for proselytism: and was distinct from ΠἾ) ,Πῖἳῂω Baptism
[or waslziny] from uneleanness. See the Babylonian Talmud
in J evamoths.

Ι. Ι ascribe the first use os it, for this end, to the patri-
arch Jacob, when he chose into his family and church the
young women of Sychem, and other heathens who then lived
with him. “Jacob said to his family, and to all who were
with him, Put away from you the strange gods, and be ye
