26 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. ii. 1.

possible, the learned Jews might read it. For since they had
little kindness for foreign books, that is, heathen books, or
such as were written in a language different from their own,
which might be illustrated from various canons, concerning
this matter; some person converted to the gospel, excited
with a good zeal, seems to have translated this Gospel of
St. Matthew out of the Greek original into the Hebrew lan-
guage, that learned men among the Jews, who as yet believed
not, might perhaps read it, being now published in their lan-
guage: which was rejected by them while it remained in a
foreign speech. Thus, I suppose, this Gospel was written in
Greek by St. Matthew, for the sake of those that believed in
Judea‚ and turned into Hebrew by somebody else, for the
sake of those that did not believe.

The same is to be resolved concerning the original language
of the Epistle to the Hebrews. That Epistle was written to
the Jews inhabiting Judea, to whom the Syriae was the
mother-tongue ; but yet it was writ in Greek, for the reasons
above named. For the same reasons, also, the same apostle
writ in Greek to the Romans, although in that church there
were Romans, to whom it might seem more agreeable to have
written in Latin; and there were Jews, to whom it might
seem more proper to have written in Syriae.

OHA P. II.

A calculation qf the times when Christ was born.

VEB. 1: Τοῦ δὲ ’[ησοῦ γεννηθέντος· Now when Jesus was
bom] We thus lay down a scheme of the times when Christ
was born :

I. He was born in the year of the world 3928.

For from the creation of the world to the deluge are
commonly reckoned 1656 years.

From the deluge to Abraham’s promise are 427 years.
This being supposed, that Abraham was born the 130th year
of Terah : which must be supposed.

From the promise given, to the going out of Egypt, 430
years, Exod. xii. 40, Gal. iii. 17.

From the going out of Egypt to the laying the foun-
dations of the Temple are 480 years, 1 Kings vi. 1.
