him a sop for a token‚ as they say who maintain that opinion:
then with what reason, or with what ignoranceu, after so clear
a discovery of the thing and person, could the disciples ima-
gine that Christ said, “ Buy quickly those things that are
necessary, or give something to the poor ΣΡ)

8. And to what poor, Ι pray? It was unseasonable, truly,
late at night, to go to seek for poor people here and there,
who were now dispersed all about in several familias (φρατρίαι),
eating the passover: for the poorest Israelite was obliged to
that duty as well as the richest. They who supposed that
Christ commanded him to give something to the poor, could
not but understand it of a thing that was presently to be
done. For it had been ridiculous to conceive, that Christ
sent him so hastily away from supper to give something to Α
the poor to-morrow. But, if it be granted that the matter
was transacted at Bethany, and that two days before the
Passover, which we assert, then it is neither necessary you
should suppose that supper to have been so late at night3 nor
were poor people‚ then and there, to be far songht for, since
so great a multitude of men followed Christ everywhere.

over: the same we conclude of that supper, John xiii, both as
to the place and time; and that, partly, by the carrying on of
the story to that time, partly, by observing the sequel of that
supper. Six days before the Passover Christ sups at Be-
thany, John xii. 1.

The next day (five days before the Passove1·)x he came to
Jerusalem riding on an ass, John xii. 12: and in the evening
he returned to Bethany, Matt. xxi. 17 ; Mark xi. 1 1.

The day following (four days before the Passover) he went
to Jerusalem, Mark xi. 11, 15, &03 and at evening he re-
turned the same way to Bethany, Mark xi. 19.

The day after (three days before the Passover), he goes
again to Jerusalem, Mark xi. 27. In the evening, he went
out to the mount of olives, Matt. xxiv. Ι, 3 ; Mark xiii. 1, 3 ;
Luke xxi. 37. Now where did he sup this night? at Bethany,
