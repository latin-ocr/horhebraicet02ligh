bound himself by a vow from this or that thing„ which was
lawful in itself; as, that he would not eat, that he would not
put on, that he would not do this or that, Sec.

nin-u: ΒἾἾἿΞ Alle epithets of vows are as the vows themselves.
They added certain short forms, by which they signified a vow,
and which carried with it the force of a VOW‚ as if the thing
were spoken out in a larger periphrasis: as for example, “ flf

that is, Let the wine which I taste be as devoted wine: as
though-he had said, I vow that I will not taste wine. ‘⁶ To
which others answered, Is not old wine good for the bowels ἓ
Then he held his peace.”

III. But above all such like forms of vowing, the word

forms frequently to occur, Ἱι) mm *mm ῙΞἾΡ, and 0:537
