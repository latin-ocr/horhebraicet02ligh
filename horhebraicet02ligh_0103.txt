to propound questions. In that remarkable story of re-

which we meet with in divers f places of both Talinuds: when
they met together in the Beth Midrash, &bum 33⁸&512737 ‘my
“ Tlce question& stood forth aad asked, The evening prayer, is

were two things especially that gave· Christ admission to
preach in every synagogue ς namely‚ the fame of his miracles,
and that he gave out himself the head of a religious sect.
For however the religion of Christ and his disciples was both
scorned and hated by the scribes and Pharisees, yet they ae-
