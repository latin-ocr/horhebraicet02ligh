Oh. xvi. ¹9·] Emercitations upon St. Blattlcew. 941 ι

Let the words be applied, by way of paraphrase, to the
matter that was transacted at present with Peter: “I am
about to build a Gentile church (saith Ch1·ist); and to thee,
O Peter, do I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven, that
thou mayest first open the door of saith to them 3 but if thou
askest, by what rule that cliurch is to be governed, when the
Mosaic rule may soem so improper for it, thou shalt be so
guided by the Holy spirit& that whatsoever of the law of
Moses thou shalt forbid them shall be forbidclen; whatsoever
thou grantest them shall be wanted, and that under a sanc-
tion made in heaven.''

Hence in that instant, when he should use his keys, that is,
when he was now ready to open the gate of the gospel to the
Gentiles, Acts x. 28, he was taught from heaven, that the con-
sorting of the J ew wit-h the Gentile‚ which before had been
bound, was now loosed ; and the eat-ing of any creature conve-

and he, in like manner, looses both these.

Those words of our Saviour‚ John xx. 23, “VVhose sins ye
remit, they are remitted to them,'' for the most part are
forced to the same sense with these before us3 when they
carry quite another sense. Here the business is of doctrine
only, not of persons,· there of persons, not of doctrine .- here of
things lawful or unlawful in religion to be determined by the
apostles3 there of persons obstinate or not obstinate, to be
punished by them, 01· not to be punished.

As to doctrine, the apostles were doubly instructed : 1. So
long sitting at the feet of their Master, they had imbibed the
evangelical doctrine. 2. The Holy Spirit directing them, they
were to determine concerning the legal doctrine and practice3
being completely instructed and enabled in both by the Holy
Spirit descending upon them. As to their persoiiS‚ they were
endowed with a peculiar gift, so that the same Spirit direct—
ing them, if they would retain and punish the sins of any, a
power was delivered into their hands of delivering to Satan, of
punishing with diseases‚ plagues‚ yea, death itse1f3 which Peter
