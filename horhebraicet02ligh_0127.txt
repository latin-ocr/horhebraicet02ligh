Oh. v. 31.] &eradamus upon St. stlattlww. 1921

“ Letr no man put away his first wife unless for adultery.''
And “ R. Eliezer saithS, For the divorcing of the first wife,
even the altar itself sheds tears.” Which Gloss they fetch
from thence, where it is said, “ Let no man deal treacherously
towards the wife of his youth 3⁹² Mal. ii. 15.

The Jews used polygalny, and the divorcing of their wives,
with one and the same license: and this, that they might
have change, and all for the sake of lust. ‘⁴ It is lawful (say
theyt) to have many wives together, even as many as you will:
but our wise men have decreed, That no man have above four
wives.” But they restrained this, not so much out of some
principles of chastity, as that lest a man, being burclened with
many wives, might not be able to afford them food and clothing,
and due benevolence: for thus they comment concerning this
bridle of polygamy.

For what causes they put away their wives there is no
need to inquire-3 for this they did for any cause of their own
free will.

l. “ It is commanded to divorce a wife that is not of good
behaviour, and who is not modest as becomes a daughter of
Israel.'⁷ So they speak in Maimonides and Gittin in the place
aboveu specified: where this also is added in the Gemarists :
“ R. Meir saith, As men have their pleasures concerning their
meat and their drink, so also concerning their wives. This
man takes out a fly found in his cup, and yet will not drink :
after such a manner did Papus Ben Judah carry himself:
who, as often as he went forth, bolted the doors and shut in
his wife. Another takes out a fly found in his cup, and drinks
up his cup ; that he doth, who sees his wife talking freely with
her neighbours and kinsfolk, and yet allows of it. And there
is another, who, if he find a fly in his basket, eats it: and
this is the part of an evil man, who sees his wife going out,
without a veil upon her head, and with a bare neck, and sees
her washingv in the baths, where men are wont to wash, and
yet cares not for it3 whereas by the law he is bound to put.
her away.'’
