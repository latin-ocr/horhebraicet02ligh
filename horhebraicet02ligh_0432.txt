426 Hebrew and Tacmudieal [Oh. ix. 49.

That very learned man mentioned before called the com-
mon reading very improper. For what is it, saith he, ἁλίζειν
πυρί, to season with fire? Let me retort‚ And what is it
πυρίζειν ἁλί, to fire with salt? And yet that sense occurs
very frequently in the Talmudists. For in them ΠἾἾΡΠ is to
burn, (which it signifies properly indeed,) and very frequently
it is, to corrupt any tlbiozy with too much saltim, so that it
cannot be eaten ε to be firecl with salt. So in this place, to be
saltecl with fire, that it cannot be corrupted or eonsumed.

Καὶ πᾶσα θυσία ἁλὶ ἁλισθήσεται· And every sacrifice shall be
saltecl with salt] Here the discourse is of salting‚ which
was done at the altar, see Levit. ii. 13 ε “ Inh the aseent of
the altar, they salted the parts of the sacrifice: and on the
top of the altar they salt the handful of meal‚ of frankin-
eense‚ of incense, and the mineha of the priests, and the
mineha of the anointed priest, and the minoha of the drink-
offerings, and the sacrifice of birds.” Yea'1‚ ῑΞἾΡ 0⁵39
3750 pzwrm ζιἻ ΠΠΞὮ ίΙιθ very woocl is α corban of the
minclca, ancl is to be salted.

But in the former clause, the allusion was not to the fire
of the altar, but to the fire in the valley of Hinn0m‚ where
dead camases, bones, and other filthy things were oon·
sumed. Carcases crawl with worms3 and instead of salt
which secures against worms, they shall be east into the fire,
and shall be seasoned with flames, and yet the worms shall
not die. But he that is a true sacrifico to God shall be sea-
sonod with the salt of grace to the incorruption of glory.

Our Saviour speaks in this place with Isaiah, ohap. lxvi. 20:
’Άξουσι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν ἐκ πάντων τῶν ἐθνῶν δῶρον Κυρίῳ-
ὡς ἀνενέγκαισαν οἳ υἱοὶ Ἰσραὴλ τὰς θυσίας αὐτῶν ἐμοὶ μετὰ
ψαλμῶν εἰς τὸν οἶκον Κυρίου· They shall briny your brethren out
os all the nations for α yzfl to the Loml, as tlte children αἶ’
Israel ‹ffir their sacrifices to me with psalms in the house of the
Lord. And ver. 24: Καὶ ἐξελεύσονται, καὶ ὄψονται τὰ κῶλα τῶν

 

ἀνθρώπων τῶν παραβεβηκότων ἐν ἐμοί· ὁ γὰρ σκώληξ αὐτῶν οὗ
τελευτήσει, καὶ τὸ πῦρ αὐτῶν οὗ σβεσθήσεται, 850. And they
shall ρο forth, and look upon the limbs of men that transyressed
ayainst me .· fin· their worm shall not die, and theirfire shall not
be quenclzed, 820.
