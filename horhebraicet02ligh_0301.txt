ἸΠἎΝῘἮΞ ’117 Hence it is decided (say they) in behaff ⁰f α ἀίε-
ciple qf the wiso men, that his fellow citizens are bound to per-
form his servile work for him.''-O money, thou mistress of
art and mother of wit! So he that was preferred to be pre-
sident of the council, was 10 be maintained and enriched by
the council! See the Gloss on Babylonian Taanitht.

They angled with a double hook among the people for re-
spect, and by respect for gain.

I. As doctors of the law: where they, first and above all
things, instilled into their disciples and the common people,
that a wise man, or a master, was to be respected above all
morta} men whatsoever. Behold the rank and order of
benches according to these judges! “Au wise man is to
take place of a king; a king of a high priest3 a high priest
of a prophet3 a prophet of one anointed for war3 one
anointed for war of a president of the courses; a president
of the courses of the head of a family3 the head of a family
of a counsellor ; a counsellor of a treasurer3 a treasurer of
a private priest3 a private priest of a Levite; a Levite of
an Israelite; an Israelite of a bast-ard3 a bastard of a Ne-
thinim3 a Nethinim of a proselyte; a proselyte of a freed
slave. But when is this to be? namely, when they are alike
as to other things ε but, indeed, if a bastard be a disciple‚ or
a wise man, and the high priest be unlearned‚ the bastard is
to take place of him. A wise man is to be preferred beforex
a king: for if a wise man die, he hath not left his equa13 but
if a king die, any Israelite is fit for a kingdom.”

This last brings to my mind those words of Ignatius the
martyr, if indeed they are his, in his tenth epistle, Τίμα, φησὶν,
υἱὲ, τὸυ Θεὸν, &c.: “My son, saith he, honour God and the
king: but I say, ‘ Honour God as the cause and Lord of all:
the bishop as the chief priest, bearing the image of God 3 in
respect of his rule bearing God’s image, in respect of his
priestly office, Christ's3 and, after him, we ought to honour
the king also.' ”

under the goodly show of long prayers, they so drew over
