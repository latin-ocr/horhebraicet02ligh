near Caesarea Philippi; perhaps that which, J osephus being
witness, was the highest, and hung over the very fountains of
Jordan, and at the foot whereof Oaesarea was placed.

ln that place, formerly called Dan, was the first idolatry
set up, and now in the same place the eternal Son of Grod is
shewn, both in the confession of Peter, and in the unspeak-
ably clear and illustrious demonstration of the Messias.

Ver. 38: Εἵδομέν τινα ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου ἐκβάλλοντα δαιμόνια·
W'e saw one castiny out devils in thy name] Ι. Without
doubt he truly did this work, whosoever he were. He cast
out devils truly and really, and that by the divine power3
otherwise Christ had not said those things which he did,
‘⁵ Forbid him not: for there is no man which shall do a
miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me‚'' &a

II. Whenee then could any one that followed not Christ
cast out devils? Or whence could any one that cast out,
devils not follow Christ?

l answerd: We suppose,

l. That this man cast not out devils in the name of J esus,
but in the name of Christ, or Messias: and that it was not
out of contempt that he followed not J esus, but out of igno-
rance3 namely‚ because he knew not yet that J esus was the
Messias.

Il. WVe therefore conjecture that he had been heretofore
some disciple of John, who had received his baptism in the
name of the Messias now speedily to come, (which all the dis-
ciples of John had 3) but he knew not as yet that Jesus of
Nazareth was the Messias: which John himself knew not
until it was revealed to him from heaven.

III. It is probablo‚ therefore, that God granted the gifts
of miracles to some lately baptized by John, to do them in
the name of the Messias; and that, to lay a plainer way for
tho receiving of the Messias5 when he should manifest himself
under the name of ‘ J esus of Naza1·eth.’

See ver. 41: In my name, ὅτι Χριστοῦ ἐστε, because με,
belomy to Christ,- and chap. xiii. 6, “ Many shall come in my
name ;'’ not in the name of Jesus, but in the name of the
Messias: for those false prophets assumed to themselves the
name of the Messias, to bring to nought the name of J esus-
