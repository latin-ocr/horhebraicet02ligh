religion. When, therefore, Christ was reckoned among the
religious, and grew so famous by the rumour of his miracles,
and the shining rays of his doctrine, no wonder if he raised
among the people an earnest desire of hearing him, and ob-
tained among the governors of the synagogues a liberty of
preaching. .

Vms. 3, 4, 5, διο. ; Μακάριοι, μακάριοι, &c. Blessed,
blessed‚ Sto] It is commanded, Deut. xxvii, that, upon the
entrance of the people into the promised land, blessings
and curses should be denounced from the mounts Gerizim
and Ebal: the curses being particularly reckoned up, but
the blessings not so. Which seems not to be without a
mystery, since the law brought the curse with it; but Christ,
who should bring the blessing, was yet to come a great
while hence. Now he is present pronouncing the blessings,
and that on a mountain. The J ewish writers do thus relate

“ Sixk tribes went up to the top of mount Gerizim, and
six to the top of mount Ebal. But the priests and the Le-
vites stood below with the ark of the covenant. The priests
compassed the ark; the Levites compassed the priests3 and
the whole people of Israel stood on one side and on the
other: as it is said, ‘ All Israel and the elders,' &e (Josh.
viii. 33.) Turning their faces to mount Gerizim, they began
with the blessing, ‘ Blessed is the man that shall make no
idol, or molten image‚' Sec. And both the one and the other
answered, Amen. Turning their faces to mount EbaL they
pronounced the curse, ⁴ Cursed is the man who shall make an
idol, or molten image ε’ and both the one and the other an-
swered, Amen. And so of the rest. And at last, turning
their faces to Gerizim, they began with the blessing, ‘ Blessed
is the man who shall continue in all the words of the law ς’
and the answer on both sides is, Amen. Turning their faces
to Ebal, they pronounce the curse, ‘ Cursed is every one that
shall not continue in all the words of the law :’ and the an-
swer from both sides is, Amen‚'‘' &a

In like manner Christ here, having begun with blessings,
