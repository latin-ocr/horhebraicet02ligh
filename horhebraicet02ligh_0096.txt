hence, because it is said, DR'WJ ΓἻᾩἾΤΠ Πᾙῗῖἶ ''f-W? 73]
‘⁸ How lony skalt I bear with this evil σοηρνερατὶοη, &c (Numb.
xiv. 27.) Take away Joshua and Galeb, and there remain
only ten ;” namely‚ of the spies of the land.

II. Of these ten men z

1. Three bear the magistracy‚ and were called 3712> ''72
Πωῖἳζζ) Tke bench of three: whose office it was to decide the
differences arising between the members of the synagogue‚
and to take care about other matters of the synagogue.
These judged concerning money-matters, thefts, losses‚ re-
stitutions, ravishing a virgin, of a man enticing a virgin, of
the admission of proselytes‚ χειροθεσία, Zayiny οη of hands,
and divers other things, of which see 'the tract Sanhedrim g·
These were properly, and with good reason, called ἀρχισυνά-
γωγοι, rulers of tlte synayogyzce, because on them laid the chief
care of things, and the chief power.

renders the word rim-³ by the word ῖ-ἳῖἸΠ one that over-

see how the reader reads, and whom he may call out to read
in the law.” The public minister of the synagogue himself
read not the law publicly; but, every sabbath, he called out
seven of the synagogue (on other days, fewer) whom he judged
fit to read. He stood by him that read, with great care ob-
serving that he r'ead nothing either falsely or improperly5
and calling him back and correcting him if he had failed in
any thing. And hence he was called ἶτΠ, that is, ἐπίσκοπος,
or overseer. Certainly the signification of the word bishop,
and anqel of the charch, had been determined with less noise,
if recourse had been made to the proper fountains, and men
