mess, Luke xxii. 53. God who had foretold of old, that the
serpent should bruise the 11661 of the promised seed, and now
that time is 001116, 116(1 slaekened the devil⁹s ehain, which, in
regard of men, the Divine Providence used to hold in his
hand; so that all the power and all the 161100111- of hell might,
freely and without restraint, assault Christ; and that all
that malice that was in the devil against the whole elect of
God, summed up and gathered together into one head, might
at one stroke and onset be brandished against Christ without
measure.

ΙΙ. Our most blessed Saviour, therefore, feeling sueh tor-
ments as either hell itself, or the instruments of hell, men
conspiring together in villany and eruelty, could pour out
upon him, eries out, under the sharpngss of the present pro-
vidence, “My God! my God! why hast thou delivered me
up and left me to such assaults, such bitternesses, and sueh
merciless hands3” The Talmudistsi bring in Esther using
such an ejaculation, which is also eited in the Gloss on J omak:
“ Esther stood in the inner court of the palaee. R.Levi saith,
When she was now just come up to the idol-temple, the divine
glory departed from her: therefore she said, Eli, Eli, lamma
azabhtani3’

Ver. 47: Ἠλίαν φωνεῖ οὗτος· This mom calloth, for Elias.
Ver. 49: Ἴδωμευ εἰ ἔρχεται Ἠλίας σώσων αὐτόν· Let us see
whether Elias will come to save kim] That Christ here used
the Syriae dialect, is plain from the word sabachthani: but
the word Eli, Eli, is not so properly Syriae: and hence
arose the error and miseonstruetion of the standers by. In
Syriae he should have said, ’Ἶῃ *m Mari, Mari: but Eli
was strange to a Syrian ear: this deeeived the standers-by,
who, having heard more than enough of the apparitions of
Elias from the Jewish fables, and being deceived by the
double meaning of the word, supposed that Christ was taint-ed
with the same folly and mistake, and called out to Elias for
help3 which it was no strange thing for that deluded people
to expect.
