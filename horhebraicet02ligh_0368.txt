362 Hebr‘ow and Talmudioal [Oh. xxvii. 9.

so much have stirred up the people of Jerusalem to take notice
of it, as such a strangling and throwing down headlong, which
we suppose horrible above measure, and singular beyond ex-
ample. See what we have said at the tenth chapter con·
cerning the word [scariot.

Ver. 9: Τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ Ἰερεμίου τοῦ προφήτου· T hat which
was spoken bys Jeremy the prophet] How much this place
hath troubled interpreters, let the famous Beza, instead of
many others, declare: ‘⁶ This knot hath hampered all the most-
ancient interpreters, in that the testimony here is taken out of
Zechariah, and not from J eremiah 3 so that it seems plainly
to have been ἁμάρτημα μνημονικὸν, a failiny of memorgs, as
Augustine supposes in his third book, ‘ De consensu evange-
listarum,' chapter the seventh; as also Eusebius in the
twentieth bookb Ἀποδείξεως, of demonstration. But if any one
had rather impute this error to the transcribers, or (as Ι
rather suppose) to the unskilfulness of some person, who
put in the name of Jeremialz, when the evangelist had writ
only, as he often doth in other places, διὰ τοῦ προφήτου, bys
,the prophet, yet we must confess that this error hath long
since crept into the Holy Scripturas, as ‚Jerome expressly
affirms,'' &c.

But (with the leave of so great men) I do not only deny
that so much as one letter is spurious, or crept in without
the knowledge of the evangelist, but Ι do confidently assert
that Matthew wrote Jeremy, as we read it, and that it was
very readily understood and received by his countrymen. We
will transcribe the following monument of antiquity out of the
TalmudistSC, and then let the reader judge: ‘⁶ A tradition of
the Rabbins. This is the order of the prophets. The Book
of J oshua, J udges, Samuel, Kings, J eremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah,
and the twelve.” And a little after: “ But since Isaiah was
before both J eremiah and Ezekiel, he ought to have been set

before them: ΝΠΞἾἸΠ ΠἻΞἾΕ 1:³³:an 15³3 but since the Book

of Kinys ends with destruction, manin ambi: ΠἾὩἾἿἹ and
all ,Ieremiah is about destruction, and since Ezekiel begins with

destruction and ends with comfort; and all Isaiah is about
comfort, snat-12³:- smmi san-nn& sin-uri puae>
