Ver. 451: Οὕτως ἔσται καὶ τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ τῇ πονηρᾷ· ›S‘o
shall it be to mis evil gyereration] These words fot-etell a dread-
ful apostasy in that nation and generation.

Ι. It is something difficult so to suit all things in the
parable aforegoing, that they may agree with one another:
1. You can hardly understand it of unclean spirits cast out
of men by Christ 3 when through the whole evangelio his-
tory there is not the least shadow of probability that any
devil cast out by him did return again into him out of whom
he had been cast. 2. Therefore our Saviour seems to allude
to the casting out os devils by exorcisms: which art, as the
Jews were well instructed in, so in practising it there was
need of dexterous deceits and collusions. 3. For it· is
scarcely credible that the devil in truth finds less rest 111 dry
places than in wet: but it is credible that those diabolical
artists have found out such kind of figments for the honour
and fame of their art. For, 4. It would be ridiculous to
think that they could by their exorcisms cast a devil out of
a man into whom he had been sent by God. They might,
indeed, with a compact with the devil, procure some lucid
intervals to the possessed; so that the inhabiting demon
might deal gently with him for some time, and not disturb
the man: but the demoniacal heats came back again at last,
and the former outrages returned. Therefore, here there was
need of deceits well put together, that so provision might the
better be made for the honour of the exorcistical art3 as⁷
that the devil, being sent away into dry and waste places,
could not find any rest 3 that he could not, that he would
not always wander about here and there, alone by himself,
without rest3 that he therefore returned into his old man-
sion, which he had formerly found so well fitted and pre—
pared for him, &c

Therefore these words seem to have been spoken by our
Saviour according to the capacity of the common people‚ or
rather, according to the deceit put upon them, more than
according to the reality or truth of the thing itself 3 taking a
