tinct knowledge, in judging of the nature and quality of the
kingdom of heaven.

Let the austerity of J ohn's life, and the very frequent fasts
which he enjoined his disciples, be well considered, and what
our Saviour saith of both, and you will easily believe that John
also, according to the universal conceit of the nation, expected
temporal redemption by the Messias, not so clearly distin-
guishing concerning the nature of the kingdom and redemp-

his doctrine3 which the obstinate expectation of that nation
unto this very day, that Elias is personally to come, witness-
eth also. Upon what ground some Christians are of the same
opinion, let themselves look to it. See the not-es on chap.

Ver. 21 : Ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι· In Tyre and Sidou] He
compares the cities of the Jews with the cities of the Ga-
naaniteS, who were of a cursed original; “ but yet these
cities, of a cursed seed and name, if they had been partakers
of the miracles done among you, had not hardened them-
selves to such a degree of madness and obstinacy as you have
