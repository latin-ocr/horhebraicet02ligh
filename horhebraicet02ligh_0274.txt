268 Hebrew and Talmude'oal [Oh. xx. 8, 13.

Hebrews concerning hiring of labourers distinguish‚ as
reason requires, between 0¹25 ἾὉζζ) bein-<7 hired by the day, and
Γ1Ἶ371ζ7 ἾὉΨ being] hired (only) for some bours .· which may be
observed also in this parable: for in the morning they are
hired for all the day, and for a penny, but afterward for
certain hours; and have a part of a penny allotted them, in
proportion to the time they wrought.

Ver. 8: Κάλεσον τοὺς ἐργάτας, &et Call the labourers]
For “it is one of the affirmative precepts of the laW, that
a hired labourer should have his wages paid him when they
are due, as it is said, ‘ You shall pay him his Wages in his
day ε’ and if they be detained longer, it is a breach of a ne-
gative precept; as it is said, ‘ The sun shall not go down
upon him g,' '' See.

the Babylonians in the place cited, ’1Πᾶ NP &D'WD ''ll'll'l

taken whether they come from several places ; for at some
places they go to work sooner, and at some later.”

Hence two things may be cleared in the parable before
us: 1. Why they are said to be hired at such different hours 3
namely‚ therefore', because they are supposed to have come
together from several places. 2. Why there was no certain
agreement made with those that were hired at the third,
sixth, and ninth hours, as with those that were hired early
in the morning3 but that he should only say, “Whatsoever
is right Ι will give you :³² that is, supposing that they would
submit to the custom of the place. But, indeed, when their
wages were to be paid them, there is, by the favour of the
lord of the vineyard‚ an equality made between those that
were hired for some hours, and those that were hired for the
