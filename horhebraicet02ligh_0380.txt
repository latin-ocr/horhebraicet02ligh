374 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. xxvii. 56.

I pronounoe &WLOD 72 Ben ‘SatdaJ not that Ι am ignorant
that it is called ‘ Ben Stada' by very learned men. The reason
of our thus pronouneing it we feteh from hence, that we
find he was called rrimw 12 Bm ›S‘zctdalz by the Jerusalem
Talmudistsd3 to which the word Satda more agrees than
&adm By the like agreement of sounds they call the same
town both &57:172 Illaydala, and &Sum Magydalffi as we
have observed elsewhere.

As they contumeliously reflect upon the ,Lord J esus under
the name of Bon Satda, 50 there is a shrewd suspicion that,
under the name of &377272 ΠἾἾΤΖ) Μανῃ Dsaydala, they also
cast reproaoh upon Alary Blagxdczlene. The title which they
gave their Mary is so like this of 01115, that you may with
good reason doubt whether she was called Illayclalene from
the town Illaqclalm 01· from that word of the Talmudists,

Ismael, Lazar, Menahem, Chelpatha, Abdimus.” Also, “ R..f
Joso Ben R. Chaninah gf &e One may well inquire why
this Mary is called the mother of ‘ J ames and Joses,’ and
not also of ⁶ Judas aud Simon,’ as Mark vi. 3.

Ver. 58 h: ’ῌτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ· Beqqed the body of
Jesus] It. was not lawful to suffer a man to hang all night
upon a tree, Deut. xxi. 23 : nay, nor to lie all night unburied:

But they that were put to death by the oouneil were not to
be buried in the sepulehres of their fathers3 but two burying-
places were appointed by the 001111011, 0110 for those that were
slain by the sword and strangled‚ the other sor those that
were stoned [who also were lcanqecl] and burnt.'' There, ac-
cording to the custom, Jesus should have been buried, had
not Joseph‚ with a pious boldness, begged of Pilate that he
might be more honourably interred : which the fathers of the
