Oh. vi. ι 3.] Eoeereications upon St. Matthew. 153

answered Amen to the prayers made by the minister: and
also at home, when the master of the family blessed or prayed;
but seldom, or indeed never, any one praying privately joined
this to the end of his prayers.

Andg now, to apply those things which have been said to
the matter under our hands, consider the following things :

1. That this prayer was twice delivered by our Saviour:
first, in this sermon in the mount, when he was not asked3
and afterward‚ when he was asked, almost half a year after,
Luke xi.

2. That this conclusion is added in St. Matthew‚ “ For
thine is the kingdon1‚” ἅπας but in St. Luke it is not. In
St. Matthew is added moreover the word Amen; but in
St. Luke it is wanting. Upon the whole matter, therefore,
we infer,

I. That Christ, in exhibiting this form of prayer, followed a
very usual rite and custom of the nation

ΙΙ. That the disciples also, receiving this form delivered
to them, could not but receive it according to the manner
and sense of the nati0n‚ used in such cases: since he in-
troduced no exception at all from that general rule and
custom.

III. Thath he scarcely could signify his mind, that this
prayer should be universally and constantly used, by any
marks or signs more clear than those which he made use
of. For,

First, He commanded all, without any exception or dis-
tinct-ion, ‘⁶ After this manner pray ye 3⁵⁹ and, “ When ye pray‚
say, Our Father‚'' &a

Secondly, As, according to the ordinary custom of the na-
tion, forms of prayer, delivered by the masters to the scholam,
were to be used, and were used by them all indifferently‚ and
without distinction of persons; so also he neither suggested
any thing concerning this his prayer, either besides the com-
mon custom, or contrary to it.

Thirdly, The form itself carries along with it certain cha-
racters, both of its public and private and constant use. It
may certainly with good reason be asked, W hy, since Christ
