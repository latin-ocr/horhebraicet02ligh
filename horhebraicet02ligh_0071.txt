be subjected under it; but especially, when it is neither
necessarily to be esteemed of the essence of baptism, and is
moreover so harsh and danger0us, that, in regal-d of these
things, it scarcely gave place to circumcision. We read that
some, leavened with J udaism to the highest degree, yet wished
that dipping in purification might be taken away, because it
was accompanied with so much seveiity. “Iny the days of
R. J oshna Ben Levi, some endeavoured to abolish this dipping,
f01 the sake of the women of Galilee3 becaus se, by reason of
the cold, they became barren. R. Joshua Ben Levi said
unto them, Do ye go about to take away that which hedges
in Israel from transgression [²³⁵ Surely it is hard to lay this
yoke upon the neck of all nations, which seemed too rough
to the Jews themselves, and not to be borne by them, men
too much given to such kind of severer rites. And if it be
demanded of them who went about to take away that dip-
ping, W ould you have no purification at all by water? it is
probable that they would have allowed of the sprinkling of
water, which is less harsh‚ and not less agreeable to the thing
itself.

3. The following ages, with good reason, and by divine
prescript, administered a baptism differing in a greater matter
from 1116 baptism of J ohn; and therefore it was less to differ
in a less matter. The application of water was necessarily
of the essence of baptism3 but the application of it in this or
that manner speaks but a circumstance: the adding also of
the word was of the nature of a sacrament; but the chang-
·ing of the word into this or that form, would you not call this
a circumstance also? And yet we read the form of baptism
so changed, that you may observe it to have been threefold in
the history of the New Testament.

Secondly‚ In reference to the form of Jolm's baptism
[which thing we have propounded to consider in the second
place], it is not at all to be doubted but he baptized “in the
name of the Messias now ready to come:'' and it may be
gathered from his words, and from his story. As yet he
knew not that J esus of Nazareth was the Messias; which he
confesseth himself, John i. 31 ε yet he knew well enough,
that the Messias was coming 3 therefore, he baptized those
