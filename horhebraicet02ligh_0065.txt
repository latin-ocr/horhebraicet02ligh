Oh. iii. 6.] Exercitations upon St. Mattkew. 59

to be celebrated there, when they were always, and every
where, well known and in daily use before the publishing of
the proclamation, and when it was published. The case is
the very same in baptism. Christ instituted it for an evan-
gelica] sacrament, whereby all should be admitted into the
possession of the gospel, as heretofore it was used for admis-
sion into proselytism to the Jewish religion. The particulars
belonging to it,—as, the manner of baptizing, the age, the sex
to be baptized, &va—had no need of a rule and definition3
because these were, by the common use of them, sufficiently
known even to mechanics and the most ignorant men.

2. On the other hand, therefore, there was need of a plain
and open prohibition that infants and little children should
not be baptized, if our Saviour would not have had them bap-
tized. For, since it was most common, in all ages foregoing,
that little children should be baptized, if Christ had been
minded to have that custom abolished, he would have openly
forbidden it. Therefore his silence, and the silence of the
Scripture in this matter, confirms Paedobaptism, and con-
tinueth it unto all ages.

Fourthly, It is clear enough, by what hath been already
said, in what sense that is to be taken in the New Testament
which we sometimes meet with,—na1nely, that the master of
the family was baptized with his whole family, Acts xvi. 15,
33, &a Nor is it of any strength which the Anti-paedobap-
tists contend for, that it cannot be proved there were infants
in those families, for the inquiry is not so proper, whether
there were infants in those families, as it is concluded truly
and deservedly,—if there were, they had all been to be bap-
tized. Nor do I believe this people, that fiocked to J ohn’s
baptism, were so forgetful of the manner and custom of the
nation, that they brought not their little children also with
them to be baptized.

Some things are now to be spoken of the manner and
form which John used.

First, In some things he seems to have followed the mamzer
whereby proselytes were baptized 3 in other things, not to have

followed them. Goncerning it the Talmudic Canons have these
saymgs :—
