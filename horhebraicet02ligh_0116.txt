to them, alive into hell' (Num. xvi. 33.) Another in the sea,
as it is written, ‘ Out of the belly of hell have Ι called, thou
hast heard my voice’ (J onah ii. 2). The third in Jerusalem,
as it is written, Thus saith the Lord, whose fire is in Sion,
and his furnace in Jerusalem? Isa. xxxi. 9. The tradition

easily appear from this Gloss and commentary of the Talmud—
ists, ‘ Of not killing :⁵³ ‘⁶ Hey is a manslayer, whosoever shall
strike his neighbour with a stone or iron, or thrust him into
the water, or fire‚ whence he cannot come out, so that he die,
he is guilty. But if 116 shall thrust another into the water or
