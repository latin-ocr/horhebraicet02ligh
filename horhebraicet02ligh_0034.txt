Therefore, these three hundred and ninety years being
added to the year of the world, 3030, when the ten tribes
fell off from the house of David, the age of the world when
Jerusalem perished, arose to the year 3420.

At that time there remained fifty years of the Babylonian
captivity to be completed. For those remarkable seventy
years took their beginning from the third year of J ehoiakim,
Dan. i. 1, whose fourth year begins the Babylonian monarchy,
J er. xxv. 1. And, in the nineteenth year of N ebuchadnezzar,
the Temple was destroyed, 2 Kings xxv. 8, when now the
twentieth year of the captivity passed; and other fifty re-
mained: which fifty being added to the year of the world
3420, a year fatal to the Temple, the years of the world
amount, in the first year of Cyrus, unto 3470.

From the first of Cyrus to the death of Christ are seventy
weeks of years, or four hundred and ninety years, Dan. ix. 24.
Add these to the three thousand four hundred and seventy,
and you observe Christ crucified in the year of the world 3960.

Caesar, the computation of his monarchy beginning from the
victory at Actium. Of which matter thus Dion Cassius

βρίου ἐγένετο· Τοῦτο δὲ οὐκ ἄλλως εἶπον, &Q “ Thism their
sea-fight was on the second of September: and. this I speak
upon no other account (for I am not wont to do it), but be-
cause then Caesar first obtained the whole power: so that
the computation of the years of his monarchy must bepre·
cisely reckoned from that very day.'' We confirm this our
computation‚ by drawing down a chronological table from
this¹year of Augustus to the fifteenth year of Tiberias, when
Christ, having now completed the nine-and-twentieth year
of his age, and entering just upon his thirtieth, was bap-

tized. Now this table, adding the consuls of every year,
we thus frame z
