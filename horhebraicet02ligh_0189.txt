put up their money. See the Aruch in U'UWDN Aponda, and

Ver. 10: Μὴ πήραν εἷς ὁδόν· Nor scrip for your journey]
The Syriae version reads, &Sinin &³75 No morse. The word
ΒἾῩΞἾΠ and ἰῬἾὮἿἾΠ is very frequent in the Talmudists.
‘⁶ b'fflffiflj isk a ieamer poue-b, which shepherds hang about
their necks‚ in which they put their victuals.'' R. Solomonl
saith almost the same thing, but that he appropriates it not
to shepherdS. The Aruch also in effect the same.

A proselyte is brought in thus speakingm3 ‘⁶ If an Israelite
approaching to the holy things shall die, how much more a

stranger, ἾῙῬἾὮἾΠΞἸ Ἱέρῃὶ &2127 wlzo eomes with his staffand

Μηδὲ δύο χιτῶνας· Nor two coccis] A single coat bespake a
meaner condition3 a double, a more plentiful. Hence is that
counsel of the Baptist, Luke iii. 1 1, ‘⁶ He that hath two coats,
let him impart to him that hath none.'' It is disputed by the
Babylonian Talmudists‚ hown far it is lawful to wash garments
*mvn ‘7127 ἹῙὯἾΠΠ, on the common days Qfa festival-mee& and the
conclusion is, “ It is lawful for him 757& ΡἾῙἸΠ ζῆἶῖδξ *1³7 ΓΝΦ
that laath one θοαί only, to wash it.''

Μηδὲ ὑποδήματα· Neitlaer slcoes] That skoes are here to be
understood, and not sandals, appears from Mark vi. 9: and
that there was a difference between these, sufficiently appears·
from these very places. The contrary to which Ι read in Beza,
not without wonder : “But then from this place (saith he), as
also from Acts xii. 8, it appears that the evangelists put no
difference between ὑποδήματα, shoes, and σανδάλια, sandals, as
Erasmus hath rightly observed.'’
