that is, Paul's master.

Secondly, it is no impertinent question, lthy Jonathan
and Onkelos did not rather translate into the Syriae lan-
guage, which was the mother-language to all the people,
when both they themselves were in J udea, while they were
employed about this work, and laboured in it for the use of
the Jews that dwelt there? To which we give this double
answer3 Ι. That, by turning it into the Chaldee language,
they did a thing that might be of use to both them that
dwelt in J udea, and in Babylon also. 2. The Syriae lan-
guage was not so grateful unte· the Jews, who used it for
their mother-tongue, as the Chaldee was3 as being a lan-
guage more neat and polite, and the mother-tongue to the
brethren in Babylon, and which they that came up out of
Babylon, carried thence with them into Judea. You may
wonder, reader, when you hear that canon which permits a
single man “ to say his prayers in any language, when he
asks those things that are needful for him, except only the
Syriae: vm& par->72 γπη pwb ³7:22 mm *nn-52 ‘vs-uz> wir-r·
Whiler lae asketh necessarias for himself, Zet kim use any lem-
yuaye but tlte Syriae? But you will laugh when you hear the
reason: ‘⁶ Therefore, by all means, because the angels do not
understand the Syriae language.”

Whether they distinguish the Syriae language here from
the pure Chaldee, is not of great moment solicitously to in-
quire: we shall only produce these things of the Glosser
upon Beracoth S, which make to our purpose 3—“ There are
some (saith he) who say, that that prayer which begins ΨἾῙἹ,
is therefore to be made in the Syriae language, because it is
a noble prayer, and that deserves the highest praise; and
therefore it is framed in the Targumistical language, that
the angels may not understand it, and envy it to us,’' ἅτε.
And a little after3 ‘⁶ It was the custom to recite that prayer
ΨΨἹΡ, ΠΨἾἽΠ *ll-1& after sermon: and the common people
were there present, who understood not the Hebrew language
at all; and therefore they appointed it to be framed in the
