Certainly, it is somewhat hard and bold to accuse the
Scripture of St. Mark as corrupt for this manner of pro-
nuncia-tion, when, among the Jews, the pronouncing of some
letters, vowels‚ and words was so different and indifferent,
that they pronounced one way in Galilee, another way in Sa—
maria, and another way in J udea. “ And I remember (saith
the famous Ludovieus de Dieuh), that I heard the excellent
Erpenius say, that he had it from the mouth of a very learned
Mamuite, that it could not be taught by any grammatical
rules, and ha1d1y by word of mouth, what sound &heva hath

That castle of noted fame which 1s called Masada' 1n J ose-
phus‚ Plinyi‚ Solinus, and others (in Hebrew ΠἾΞὮ), in
Strabok is Mousada, very agreeable to this our sound : Πέτρας
τινὰς ἐπικεκαυμένας δεικνύουσι τραχεΐας περὶ Μοασάδα· These]
show some scorcloed rocks about ‘Moasada.' WVhere, without
all controversy, he speaks of Masada.

II. There is a controversy also about the word eryes: it is
obscure, in what manner it isapplied to thunder. But give
me your judgment‚ courteous reader‚ what &ww is in this
story: ‘⁴ The1 father of Samuel sat in the synagogue of
Shaph, aud Jathib, in Nehardea: mmm wan& ίῘὸθ (livine

qlory caman pm &³71 κωλῆ ³7¹³? {mm lae heard tlte ἰὀῐσθ of
ΝΨΓἾ “]ῗῖ[]5]ια,’ ctml went not οιιί ; the angels came, and he
was affrighted.''

Of the word ΝΨᾸἾἾ Εἰρεῖια, the Glossers say nothing. And
we do not confidently render it Munden- nor yet do we well
know how to render it better: if so be it doth not denotem
ἦχος ὥσπερ φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας, the sound as of α miylzty
ruskiny wind, Acts ii. 2 ε but let the reader judge.

ΙΙΙ. As obscure is the reason of the name imposed upon
these two disciples, as the derivation of the word. We have
only this certain in this business, that we never find them
called by this name elsewhere. Christ called Simon Peter,
and likewise others called him Peter, and he calls himself so.
