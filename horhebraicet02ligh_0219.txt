everywhere with these figures, the nation inolining by a kind
of natural genius to this kind of rhetoric. One might not
amiss call their religion Parabolical, folded up within the
coverings of ceremonies 3 and their ‘'oratory in their sermons
was like to it. But it is a wonder indeed, that they who
were so given to and delighted in parables, and so dextrous
in unfolding them, should stick in the outward 811611 of cere-

private along the sown fields ; see chap. xii. 1. Hence in the
tract Pealz Ζ, where they dispute what those things are
which divide a field so that it owes a double corner to the
poor; thus it is determined, “These things divide: a river,
an aqueduct, a private way, a common way, a common path,
and a private path,'' &c. See the place and the Gloss.
