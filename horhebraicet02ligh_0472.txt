(ΓῑἍΠ) common cattle : the school of Hillel saith, Let it be of
the tithes. What is it that it teaches of the Ohayiyak of
the first fea-st day of the Passover ,9 Rabh Ishai saith, suun
ΓΝ 'Um the ⁴ Okayiyah' ⁰f thefifteentlz day is so: &³7 '7³ swllfl
the ‘ Chayiyak' qs the four-coenat, now The Gloss is; “ The
burnt offerings of appearance were not offered the first day of
the feast, although they were due to the feast, because com-
pensation might be made by them the day following.”

“ The ⁴ Olzayiyah‘ of the first feast day was without doubt
due ; although it had flesh enough otherways.'' For, as it is
said a little before, “They offered peace offerings on that
feast day rar-vn ‘vm-mlv *mr nrm urm '5³72 because they
laad need of them χόν private food:” and although there was
food enough, yet the Olcayiyak was to be offered as the due of
the day.

“The Ohayiyalz of the fourteenth day was this, mmmm:
rmum ΠΟΞ ΠἾἾΞΠ wlceoz any φρατρία, company, was numerous,
they joined the Olcayiffalc also with the paschal lamb, that they
might eat the passover, even till they were filled. But now
the Ohayiyalc of that first day was not but of common cattle:
but the Chayz'yak of the fourteenth day might also be os the
tithes.”

It was a greatert matter to offer of common cattle (or
cholin) than os the tithes of the first-born, for they were
owing to the Lord by right: but to offer the cholin [ΓῖἎΠ]
was the part of further devotion and free will.

That therefore which John saith, that “the Jews would
not go into the judgment hall lest they should be polluted,
but that they might eat the passover,’' is to be understood
of that C'lzayiyah of the fifteenth day, not of the paschal lamb:
for that also is called the passover‚ Deut. xvi. 23 ‘⁴ Thou shalt
sacrifice the pass-over to the Lord of thy flocks and of thy
herds.” Of tkyflocks; this indeed, by virtue os that precept,
Exod. xii. 3 ε but what have we to do with herds? “ ‘ Of thy
herds‚' saith R. Solomon, for the 0]ια9’ἱ9α]ι.” And Aben Ezra
saith, “ ‘ Of thy flocks‚' according to the duty of the passover;
‘ of thyu herds‚’ for the peace offerings,” and produceth that,
