the earth, bat riyhteouszzess shall looh down from heaven. My
fathers laid up treasure that bears no fruit; but Ι lay up such
as bear fruit; as it is said, It shall be well with the just, for
they shall eat the fruit of their worhs. My fathers treasured
up where power was in their hands3 but I where it is not3 as
it is said, ,Justice anal judyment is the habitation of his throne.
My fathers heaped up for others; Ι for myself; as it is said,
And this shall be to thee for riyhteoasness'. They scraped
together for this world3 I for the world to come3 as it is said,
Riylateousness shall cleliverfi¹0m (leath.'” These things are also
recited in the Babylonian Talmudq.

You see plainly in what sense he understands riyhteoasness‚
namely, in the sense of alms: and that sense not so much
framed in his own imagination, as in that of the whole nati0n‚
and which the royal catechumen had imbibed from the Phari-
sees his teachers.

Behold the justifying and saving virtue of alms from the
very work done, according to the doctrine of the Pharisaical
chair. And hence the opinion of this efficacy of alms so farr
prevailed with the deceived people, that they pointed out alms
by no other name (confined within one single word) than
ΠρἿΞ riyhteousness. Perhaps those words of our Saviour are
spoken in derision of this doctrine; “ Yea, give those things
which ye have in alms, and behold all things shall be clean to
you,'' Luke xi. 41. With good reason, indeed, exhorting them
to give alms, but yet withal striking at the covetousnessS of
the PhariseeS, and confuting their vain opinion of being clean
by the washing of their hands, from their own opinion of the
efficacy of alms. As if he had said, “ Ye assert that alms
justifies and saves3 and therefore ye call it by the name of
riyhteousness : why, therefore, do ye affect cleanness by the
washing of hands, and not rather by the performance of
charity ‘3¹’ See the praises of alms‚ somewhat too high for it,
in the Talmudt.

“ R. ,J annai ¹² saw one giving money openly to a poor man;
to whom he said, It is better you had not given at all, than
so to have given.”
