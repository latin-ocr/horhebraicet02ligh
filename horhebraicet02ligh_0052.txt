46 Hebrew ancl Talnmdical [Oh. iii. 2.

Judea, John's native soil, is called by the Talmudists, ἾΠ
*rba-5 The νομαί mountain, or ln'lh· and by the Psalmist,

ΕἿἾζῐ ἾᾏἾᾩ The desert hill-country, Psalm lxxv. 6 ; and yet
“in the royal mountain were a myriad of citiesP.'’

ΙΙΙ. David passed much of his youth in the wilderness,
1 Sam. xvii. 28: but yet, who will call him an eremite? In
the like sense I conceive John living in the deserts, not only
spending his time in leisure and contemplation, but employ-
ing himself in some work, or studies. For when I read, that
the youth of our Saviour was taken up in the carpenter's
trade, I scarcely believe his forerunner employed his youth in
no calling at all.

Beginning now the thirtieth year of his age, when, accord-
ing to the custom of the priests, he ought to have corne to
the chief Sanhedrim to undergo their examination, and to be
entered into the priesthood by them, “ the word of God
coming unto him‚” Luke iii. 2, as it had done before to the
prophets, he is diverted to another ministry.

Ver. 2: Μετανοεῖτε· Repent sesa] A doctrine most fit. for
the gospel, and most suitable to the time, and the word or the
phrase as agreeable to the doctrine.

I. A nation leavened wit-h the error of the pharisees, con-
cerning justification by the works of the law, was necessarily
to be called off to the contrary doctrine of repentance. No
receiving of the gospel was otherwise to be expected.

II. However the schools of the Pharisees had illy defined
repentance, which we observe presently, yet they asserted
that repentance itself was necessary to the reception of the
Messias. Ooncerningq this matter the Babylonian Gema-
rists do dispute: whom Kimchi also upon Isa. lix. 19 cites,
and determines the question : “ From the words of our Rab-
bins (saith he) it is plain there arose a doubt among them
concerning this matter, namely, whether Israel were to be
redeemed with repentance or without repentance. And it
sprang from this occasion, that some texts of Scripture
seemed to go against them: such as those 3 ‘ He saw, and
there was no man, and he wondered, that there was none to
intercede3 thereforer‚ his own arm brought salvation.’ And
