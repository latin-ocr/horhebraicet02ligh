IV. ‘⁶ When there were two bed-S, ΨΝἾΞ :Dm ‘7572 the
worthiest person lay upperm086; the second to him, next above
him. But when there were three beds, the worthiest· person
lay in the middle, the second above him, the third below
himyJ’ On which thus the Gloss: ‘⁴ When there were two,
the principal person lay on the first couch, and the next to
him lay above him, that is, on a couch placed at the pillow
of the more worthy person. If there were three, the worthiest
. lay in the middle, the next above him, and the third below
him23 that is, at the coverlids of his feet. If the principal
person desires to speak with the second, he must necessarily
raise himself so as to sit upright; for as long as he sits
bending he cannot speak to him; for the second sat behind
the head of the first, and the face of the first was turned
another away: and it would be better with the second [in
respect of discourse] if he sat below him 3 for then he might
hear his words, even as he lay along.'' This affords some
light to that story, John xiii. 23, 243 where Peter, as seems
likely, lying behind our Saviour's head in the first place next
after him, could not discourse with him, nor ask about the
betrayer: therefore looking over Christ's head upon John, he
gave him a sign to inquire. He sitting in the second place
from Christ with his face towards him, asketh him,

Ver. 22: Μήτι ἐγώ εἰμι, Κύριε; Lord, is it [ἕ] The very
occasion, namely, eating together and fellowship, partly
renews the mention of the betrayer at the Paschal supper3
as if he had said, “ We are eating here friendly together, and
yet there is one in this number who will betray me :'' partly,
that the disciples might be more fully acquainted with the
matter itself : for at the supper in John xiii, he had pri-
vately discovered the person to John only; unless perhaps
Peter understood it also, who knew of John’s question to
Christ, having at first put him upon it by his beckoning.
The disciples ask, Is it I ,9 partly through ignorance of the

thing, partly out of a sincere and assured profession of the
contrary.
