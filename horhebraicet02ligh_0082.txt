one, it was appointed to be said, ΞΞἾὩΠ ἾὩἸ ΕῘἋῺΠ ’(73 for
ever and ever, or from aye to aye? Upon these words thus

the Gloss3 “ In the first Temple they said only, ‘ Blessed be
the Lord God of Israel for ever? But when the heretics
brake in and said there was no age but this, Ezra and his con-
sistory appointed that it should be said, Dlffiyffi *nn Ulffiy'fl ἴῃ
sbr ever and ever, or from aye to aye, to imply there is a double
world [this, and 0110 to come], to root out of the heart the
opinion of those that deny the resurrection of the dead.''

Take notice, reader, that “ there were some who denied
the resurrection of the dead in the days of Ezra‚'' when as
yet Zadoc, the father of the Sadducaes, was not born. After
Ezra, and his great synagogue (which endured many a year
after Ezra was dead), sat Simeon the Just, performing the
office of the high-priest, for the space of forty years: and
Antigonus Soeheus, the master of Zadoc, succeeded him in
the chair of the Sanhedrim. So that although the Saddu-
cees, with good reason, do bear an ill report for denying the
resurrection, ancl that was their principal heresy3 yet that
heresy was, when as yet there were 110 heretics, called by
the name of Sadducees. To which, perhaps, those words do
agree (which sufficiently taste of such a heresy), “Ye have
said, It is in vain to serve G0d‚’' &c.‚ Mal. iii. ¹4·

It is not, therefore, to be denied that the Sadduoee-heretics
were so named from Zadoc; but that the heresy of the Sad-
ducees, concerning the resurrection, was older than that name,
one may suppose not without reason3 nor that that cursed
doctrine first arose from the words of Antigonus, illy under-
stood by Zadoc and Baithus, but was of an ancienter original,
when as yet the prophets Zechafias, Malachi, and Ezra him-
sels, were alive, if that Ezra were not the same with Malachi,
as the Jews suppose. Therefore I do rather think that heresy
sprang from the misunderstanding of the words of Ezekiel,
chap. xx3<vii3 which some understanding according to the let-
ter, and, together with it, seeing no resurrection, dreamt that
there would be none afterward. And this doctrine increased‚
and exalted itself into a secu when, at length, Zadoc and
Baithus asserted that it was so determined out of the chair
by their master Antigonus ¹¹, the president of the Sanhedrim.
