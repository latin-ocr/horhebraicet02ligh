that he would do, or not do, this or that, Sco. And this was
one of the 35:75& *ww ῃἺἻῑῃ ΠἾῺἾΞῈ &wofold oallcs, which
were also fowfolcl; that is, a negative or affirmative oath;
and again, a negative or affirmative oath concerning some-
thing past, or a negative or affirmative oath concerning some-
thing to come: namely, when any one swears that he hath'
done this or that, or not done it; or that he will do this or
that, or that he will not do it. ‘⁶ VVhosoever, therefore, swears
any of these four ways, and the thing is not as he swears, (for
example, that he hath not cast a stone into the sea, when he
hath cast it; that he hath cast it, when he hath not3 that he
will not eat, and yet eats ; that he will eat, and yet eateth not‚)
behold, this is a false cath, or perjuryl.''

“ W hosoeverm swears that he will not eat, and yet eats
some things which are not sufficiently fit to be eaten‚ this
man is not guilty.''

Secondly¹¹, &w nffimz) A vain or α rask oath. This also
is fourfold, but not in the same manner as the former:
1. When they asserted that with an oath which was contrary
to most known truth3 as, “ If he should swear a man were
a woman, a stone-pillar to be a pillar of gold,'' ὤας or when
any swore that was or was not, which was altogether im·
possible3 as, “ that he saw a camel fiying in the air.'' 2.
When one asserted that by an oath, concerning which there
was no reason that any should doubt. For example, that
“ Heaven is heaven, a stone is a stone‚” διο. 3. When a man
swore that he would do that which was altogether impos-
sible3 namely‚ “ that he would not sleep for three days and
three nights3 that he would taste nothing for a full week‚”
διο. 4. W hen any swore that he. would abstain from that
which was connnanded3 as, “ that he would not wear phylac-
tories,” &c These very examples are brought in the places
alleged.

Thirdly, VNDE ΓῚΞΠΞΨ An occtlc concerm‘ny sometloiny left in
trust: namely, when any swore concerning something left in
trust with him, that it was stolen or broke οι· lost, and not
embezzled by him, ὅτε.
