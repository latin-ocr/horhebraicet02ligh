12 Hebrew and Talmmlieal [Oh. i. 1 1.

(ff Psalm xxxvii. 28. Let the studious reader observe that,
in the original, in this very place, the letter 37 (Ain), which is

the last letter of :7an marked,- and of ὩἾΤ seed, is cut off, and
is not expressed3 when, by the rule of acrostic verse (ac-
cording to which this Psalm is composed), that letter ought-
to begin the next following verse.

111. “ Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven imaga
&a For Ι the Lord thy God am a jealous God3 visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and
fourth generation‚'’ Exod. xx. 5.

Joramq walked in the idolatrous ways of the kings of
Israel, according to the manner of the family of Ahab‚
2 Kings viii. 18. Which horrid violation of the second com-
mand God visits upon his posterity, according to the threat-

computes. the years. A fatal thing surely! that the years

of a king of J udah should be reckoned by the account of the
house of Omri.

V. Let a genealogie-al style not much different be observem
Ι Chron iv. 1 ; where Shobal, born in the fifth or sixth gene-
ration from J udah‚ is reckoned as if he were an immediate
son of Judah. Compare chap. ii. 50.

Jochanan; the second, Joachim 3 the third, Zedekialn the
