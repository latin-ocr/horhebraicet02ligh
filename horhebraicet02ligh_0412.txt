had no sounder, nor holier, nor wiser conceit of him3 but it-
is scarcely credible that they thought him to be fallen into
plain and absolute madness, and pure distraction. For he
had conversed among ther multitudes before, at all times
in all places; and yet his friends do not say this of him. But
now he was retired to his own house at Oapernaum, where he
might justly expect rest and repose; yet the multitudes rush ⁴,
upon him there, so that he could not enjoy his table and his
bed at his own home. Therefore his friends and kinsfolk of
Nazareth (among whom was his mother, ver. 31), hearing '
this, unanimously run to him to get him away from the
multitude3 for they said among themselves, Ἐξέστη, He ‘e's

too much transportati beyond himself, and is forgetful of him-
sels.

This our evangelist useth also another word, and that
numberless times almost: the others also use it, but not so
f1·equently; namely‚ the word εὐθὺς, and εὐθέως, presently3
which answereth to the word '7⁵0 out of hand, most common
among the Talmudists. We meet with it in this our evan-
gelist seven or eight times in the first chapter, and elsewhere
very frequently : and that not seldom according to the custom
of the idiom, more than out of the necessity of the thing sig-
nified.
