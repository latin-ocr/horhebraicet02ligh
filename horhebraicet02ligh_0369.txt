You have this tradition quoted by David Kilnchi in his
preface to J eremiah. VVhence it is very plain that J cremiali
of old had the first place among the prophete: and hereby
he comes to be mentioned above all the rest, Matt. xvi. 14,
because he stood first in the volume of the prophets, there-

a text of Zechariah under the name of Jcrcmps, he only
cites the words of the volume of the prophets under his
name who stood first in the volume of the prophets. Of
which sort is that also of our Saviour, Luke xxiv. 443 “ All
things must be fulfilled, which are written of me in the Law,
and the Prophets, and the Psalms.'' ‘⁶ In the Psalms ;'’ that
is, in the Book of Hagiographa‚ in which the Psalms were
placed first.
