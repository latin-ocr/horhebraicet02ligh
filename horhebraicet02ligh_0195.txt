Ch. x. 34] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 189

“ Then scholars of Shammai and Hillel came to the cham-
ber of Chananiah Ben Ezekiah Ben Garon, to visit him: that
was a woful day, like the day wherein the golden calf was
made. The scholars of Shammai stood below, and slew some
of the scholars of Hillel. The tradition is, That six of them
went up, and the rest stood there present with swords and
spears.''

It passed into a common proverb, that “Elias the Tish-
bite himself could not decide the controversies between the
scholars of Hillel and the scholars of Shammai.” They
dream they were determined by a voice from heaven; but
certainly the quarrels and bitternesses were not at all de-
cided. ”

“ Before⁰ the Bam Kol [in Jabneh] went forth, it was law-
ful equally to embrace either the decrees of the school of
Hillel, 01· those of the school of Shammai. At last the Batlz
Kol came forth, and spake thus; ‘ The words, both of the
one party and the other, are the words of the living G0d3
but the certain decision of the matter is according to the de-
crees of the school of Hillel.* And from thenceforth, whoso- ·
ever shall transgress the decrees of the school of Hillel is
guilty of death.”

And thus the controversy was decided3 but the hatreds
and spites were not so ended. I observe, in the Jerusalem
GemaristsP, the word ἾἾἾὯΦ Shamotki, used for a scholar of
Skammai: which I almost suspect, from the affinity of the
word 2⁵2wa Shammatha, which signifies Anathema, to be a
word framed by the scholars of Hillel, in hate, ignominy, and
reproach of those of Shammai. And when I read more than
once of R. Tarphon's being in danger by robbers, because in
some things 116 followed the custom and manner of the school
of Shammai3 I cannot but suspect suares were daily laid by
one another, and hostile treacheries continually watching to
do each other mischief.

‘⁶ R. Tarphonq saith, ‘ As I was travelling on the way, I went
aside to recite the phylacteries, according to the rite of the
school of Shammai, and I was in danger of thieveS.’ They said
