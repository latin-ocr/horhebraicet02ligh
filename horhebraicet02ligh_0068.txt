62 Hebrew and Talmzodical [Oh. iii. 6.

whether he were washed from pollution‚ or baptized into pros-
elytism], “must dip his whole body, now stripped and made
naked, at one dipping. And wheresoever in the law washing
of the body or garments is mentioned, it means nothing else
than the washing of the whole body. For if any wash him-
self all over, except the very top of his little finger, he is still
in his uncleanness. And if any hath much hair, he must
wash all the hair of his head, for that also was reckoned for
the body. But if any should enter into the water with their
clothes on, yet their washing holds good 3 because the water
would pass through their clothes, and their garments would
not hinder it.’'

And now, a little to compare the baptism of John with
that proselytical baptism, and ours with both, these things
are to be considered :--

I. If you compare the washing of polluted persons, pre-
scribed by the law, with the baptism of proselyteS,—both that
and this imply uncleanness, however something different5
that implies legal uncleanness,—this, heathen,—-but both pol-
luting. But a proselyte was baptized not only into the wash-
ing-off of that Gentile pollution, nor only thereby to be trans-
planted into the religion of the Jews3 but that, by the most

woman, 110 might produce a free and legitimate seed, and an
undefiled offspring. Hence, servants that were taken into 3
family were baptized,—and servants also that were to be
made free: not so much because they were defiled with
heathen 1111010311ηο88, as that, by that rite 5:27 ³7:³7 &munz
becominy Israelites in all respects, they might be more fit
to match with IsraeliteS, and their children be accounted as
Israelites. And hence the sons of proselytos, in following
generations, were circumcised indeed, but not baptized. They
were circumcised, that they might take upon themselves the
obligation of the law; but they needed not baptism, because
they were already Israelites. From these things it is plain
that there was some difference 38 10 1110 end, between the
Mosaical washings of unclean persons, and the baptism of
proselytes; and some between the baptism of proselytes and
John’s baptism: not as though they concurred not in some
