328 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxvi. 3.

speaking of the manner of pumping out [expiseandi] evidence
against a heretic and seducer of the people: ‘⁶ They place
(say they) two witnesses in ambush, in the inner part of the
house, and him in the outward, with a candle burning by him
that they may see and hear him. Thus they dealt with Ben
Satda in Lydda. They placed two disciples of the wise in
ambush for him, and they brought him before the council,
and stoned him.'' The Jews openly profess that this was
done to him in the days of R. Akiba, long after the destruc-
tion of the city; and yet then, as you see, the council still
retained its authority in judging of capital causes. They
might do it for all the Romans, if they dared do it to the
criminals.

But so much thus far concerning its authority : let us now
speak of its present seat. ⁴⁵ Thed council removed from the
chamber Gazith to the sheds, from the sheds into Jerusalem,
from Jerusalem to Jafne, from J afne to Osha, from Osha to She-
pharaama, from Shepharaama to Bethshaarim, from Bethshaa-
rim to Tsippor, from Tsippor to Tiberias‚'' Sco. We conjecture
that the great bench was driven from its seat, the chamber
Gazith, half a year. or thereabout, before the death of Ghrist3
but whether they sat then in the sheds [a place in the Oourt
of the Gentiles] or in the city, when they debated about the
death of Christ, does not clearly appear, since no authors
make mention how long it sat either here or there. Those
things that are mentioned in chap. xxvii. 4—-6, seem to argue
that they sat in the Temple; these before US‚ that they sat
in the city. Perhaps in both places3 for it was not unusual
with them to return thither, as occasion served, from whence
they came; only to the chamber Gazith they never went
back. Whence the Gloss upon the place lately cited, “ They
sat in Jafne in the days of Rabban Joehanam in Osha, in
the days of Rabban Gamalie13 for they returned from Osha
to Jafne‚” &c. Thus the council, which was removed from
Jerusalem to Jafne before the destruction of the city, re-

· turned thither at the feast, and sat as before. Hence Paul

is brought before the council at Jerusalem when J asne at that
time was its proper seat. And hence Rabban Simeon, presi-
