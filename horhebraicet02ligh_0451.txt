Ch. xiii. 32] Emeroo'tations upon St. Mark. 445

things which flowed from the anointing of the Holy Spirit,
and from immediate revelati0n; not from the hypostatic
union of the natures. So that those things which were re-
vealed by Christ to his church, he had them from the revela-
tion of the Spirit, not from that union. Nor is it any
derogation or detraction from the dignity of his person, that
he saith, ‘ He knew not that day and hour of the destruction
of Jerusalem 3' yea, it excellently agrees with his office and
deputation‚ who, being the Father's servant, messenger, and
minister, followed the orders of the Father, and obeyed him
in all things. “ The Son knoweth not,'' that is, it is not
revealed to him from the Father to reveal to the church.
Rev. i. Ι, “ The revelation of J esus Christ, which God gave
unto him.”

We omit inquiring concerning the knowledge of Christ,
being now raised from death: whether, and how far, it ex-
ceeded his knowledge, while yet he conversed on earth. It
is without doubt, that, being now raised from the dead, he
merited all kind of revelation (see Rev. v, 9, “ And they sung
a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and
to open the seals thereos : for thou wast slain,’' &c.); and
that he, conversing on earth before his death, acted with the
vigour of the Holy Spirit and of that unspeakable holiness
which flowed from the union of the human nature with the
divine, the divineg nature, in the meantime, suspending its
infinite activity of omnipotence So that Christ might work
miracles, and know things to come, in the same manner as
the prophets also did, namely, by the Holy Ghost, but in a
larger measure; and might overcome the devil not sc much
by the omnipotence of the divine nature, as by the infinite
holiness of his person, and of his obedience. So that if you
either look upon him as the minister and servant of G0d;
or if you look upon the constitution, as I may so call it, and
condition of his person, these words of his, “ Of that day and
hour knoweth not the Son also‚'' carry nothing of incongruity
along wit-h them; yea, do excellently speak out his substitu-
tion as a servant, and the constitution of his person as Θεάν-
θρωπος, God-man.
