Ch. xxi. 8 .] Emrcaations upon St. Matthew. 271

command of the laW, Exod. xii. 3 3 “ In the tenth day of this
mouth, they shall take to them every man a lamb.”

It soarce appears to the Talmudists, how those words of
Daniel concerning the Messias, that “ he comes with the
clouds of heaven,'’ arex consistent with these words of Ze-
chax-iah, that “ he comes sitting upon an ass'’ “ If (say
theyy) the Israelites be good, then he shall come with the
clouds of heaven; but if not good, then riding upon an ass.'' ·
Thou art much mistaken, O Jew: for he comes “in the
clouds of heaven‚’' as judge and revenger, because you are
evil and very wicked; but sz'ttz‘ny upon an ass, not because
you are, but because he is, good. 24:³70 *⁶¹:127 ³⁸³7 ἾὩΝ

ΒΝἸῺΨΒ Κίη9 Sapores said to Samuel, ‘ You say your Messias
will come upon an ass, I will send him a brave horse? He
answers him, ‘ You have not a horse with a hundred spots as
is his ass2.” In the greatest humility of the Messias they
dream of grandem, even in his very ass..

Ver. 8: Κλάὸους ἐστρώννυον ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ· ›S'trewed branchos in

perhaps might have thrown down the rider ; but by the way-
side they made little tents and tabernacles of clothes aud
boughs, according to the custom of the feast of Tabernacles.
John also adds, that taking branchos of palm trees (ΓΞῙἛῚΙὩ)
in their hands, they went forth to meet him. That book of
Maimonides entitled ΞῖἳἹῖὩἿ ΠΞἾΕ) T abernaoles aad palm-
branokes, will be an excellent comment on this place, and so
will the Talmudic treatise‚ Suo-cala. We will pick out these
few things, not unsuitable to the present story : “ Dotha any
one spread his garment on his tabernacle against the heat of
the sun, &03 it is absurd3 but if he spread his garment for
comeliness and ornament, it is approved.'' Again, “ Theb
boughs of palm ‘trees⁷ of which the law, Lev. xxiii. 40, speaks,
are the young growing sprouts of palms, before their leaves
shoot out on all sides3 *but when they are like small staves,
and these are called 2555? And a little after, “It is a
notable precept, to gather :2³75ss yoany branchos qs pal-ms, and
