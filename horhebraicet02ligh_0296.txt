Concerning the chairs of the Sanhedrim there is mention
made in Bab. Saccalzb .· “ There were at Alexandria seventy-
one golden chairs, according to the number of the seventy-one
elders of the great council.” Concerning the authority of
Moses ancl his vicegerent in the council, there is also men-
tion in Sanlaedrimi : “ The great council consisted of severity-
one elders. But whence was this number derived? From
that place where it is said, ‘ Ohoose me out seventy men of
the elders of Israel: and Moses was president over them.'
Behold seventy-one !''

What is here observed by Galatinus from the signification
of the aorist ἐκάθισαν, sat, is too light and airy: “ He saith,
They sat (saith he), and not, They sit, that he might plainly
demonstrate, that their power was then ceased-i.” But if we
would be so curious to gather any thing from this aorist,
we might very well transfer it to this sense rather: ‘⁶ The
scribes and PhariseeS, the worst of men, have long usurped
Moses's seat3 nevertheless, we ought to obey them, because,
by the dispensation of the divine providence, they bear the
chief magistracy.'⁸

Concerning their authority, thus Maimonidesk : ‘⁴ The great
council of Jerusalem was *mmm *17³9 (στύλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα,
thel pillar and 9rouncl) tho qrmmd of the traditional law, and.
the pillar of doctrine: whence proceeded statutes and judg-
ments for all Israel. And concerning them the law assei-ts
this very thing, saying, ‘ Accordingm to the sentence of the
law which they shall teach thee.' Whosoever, therefore, be-
lieves Moses our master and his law, is bound to rely upon
them for the things of the law.’'

Christ teacheth, that they were not to be esteemed as ora-
cles‚ but as magistrates.
