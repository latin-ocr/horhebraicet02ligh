Keturah were dispersed‚ are more particularly called the
‘ eastern' countries, Gen. xxv. 6, Judg. vi. 3, and elsewhere
often. And hence came, these first—fruits of the Gentiles:
whence it is not unlikely that J ethro also came, the first pros-
elyte to the law. And that which is spoken by the Gemara
concerning the Arabiam, the first pointe1·-out of the Messias
born, is perhaps some shadow of this story of the magicians’
coming out of Arabia, and who first publicly declared him to
be born.

Ver. 2: Εἵδομευ γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὸν ἀστέρα ἐν τῇ ἀνατολῇ· For
we have seen lenis star in the east] We, being in the east,
have seen his star :—that heavenly light, which in that very

his eyes upon a young maid [Qf that family} On a certain
day he heard the Bata Kol [a voice from heaven] saying,
Whatsoever servant shall now rebel shall prosper. He arose
up against his masters, and slew them all.’' And a little
after3 “ Herod said, Who is there that interprets these
words, ‘ Thou shalt set a king over thee out of the midst of
thy brethren ζ’ (Deut. xvii. 15.) The Rabbins [interpreted the
words]. He rose up and slew all the Rabbins, leaving only
Bava Ben Buta, with whom he consulted.''

Herod was to overcome two difficulties, that he might,
with the peace and favour of the Jews, become their king.
