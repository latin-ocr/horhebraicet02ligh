after morning prayers are ended, until the end of the sixth

proviso, that nothing be wanting of the number of three-and-
twenty upon the bench continually during the whole time of
the session (συμβούλιον, the constellation). If any must go out,
let him look round, whether his colleagues be three-and-
twenty: if they be, let him go out: but if not, let him wait
till another enter in?q

which pleases me not at all. For it is plainly said by Pilate
himself, “that Ι should release unto you one at the Pass-
over,'' John xviii. 39: and the releasing of a prisoner suits
not so well to the other feasts as to the Passover3 because
the Passover carries with it the memory of the release of the
people out of Egypt: but other i'easts had other respects.
