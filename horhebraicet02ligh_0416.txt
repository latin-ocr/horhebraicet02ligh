was, and that the region of the Gadarenes was included
within it. For whether it were called so from the old Ger-
yaslcz'te family of the Ganaanites, or from the muddy and
clayey nature of the soil, which was called &mmm Gerqishta
by the Jews, which we rather believe; it was of wider ex-
tension than the country of the Gadarene& which denoted
only one city, and the smaller country about it, and that
belonged to Gadara. But this country comprehended within
it the country of Gadara, of Hippo, and of Magdala, if not
others also.

II. We say Gadara was a city of heathens, (hence it is
less marvel if there were swine among themz) which we
prove also elsewhere, when we treat of the region of
Decapolis.

ΙΙΙ. We say there were two possessed persons according
to Matthew, one a Gadarene, another coming from some
other place than the country of Gadara, namely, from some
place in the country of the Geryesenes.

IV. We believe that that Gadarene was a heathen3 and
that Mark and Luke mentioned only him on set purpose,
that so they might make the story the more famous. Any
one skilled in the chorography of the land of Israel might
understand that the country of the Gaclarenes was of heathen
possession: they therefore mark him with that name, that it
might presently be perceived that Christ now had to do
with a heathen possessed person3 which was somewhat rare,
and except the daughter of the Syrophoenician woman,
without any example. Matthew would describe the great-
ness of the miracle3 he therefore mentions two most miser-
ably possessed persons: but Mark and Luke choose out only
one, and him more remarkable for this very thing, that he
was a Gadarene, and by consequence a heathen. These
things, well weighed, do not only confirm the concord be-
tween the evangelists, but render the story far clearer.
For,

First, It is to be marked that the devil adjures Christ
not to “ torment ’² him, ver. 7, which is not elsewhere donc by
him: as though he were without Christ's jurisdiction, not

being among his people the Jews, but among the heathens.
