The reason of the latter (with which our business is) is
to be fetched thence, that Oanaan himself inhabited a pecu-
liar part of that (northern) country, with his first-born sons,
Sidon and Heth: and thence the name of Oanaanites was
put upon that particular progeny, distinguished from all his
other sons; and that country was peculiarly called by the
name of ‘ Oanaan,’ distinctly from all the rest of the land
of Canaan. Hence Jabin, the king of Hazor, is called the
‘ king of (lanaanss Judg. iv. 2, and the kings of Tyre and
Sidon, if Ι mistake not, are called ‘ the kings of the Hittites?

ll. Ἑλληνὶς, Συροφοίιίσσα· Α Greek woman, a Syrophoeni-
cz'an] Although Judea, and almost the whole world, had now
a long while stooped under the yoke of the Romans, yet the
memory of the Syro—Grecian kingdom, and the name of the
nation, was not yet vanished. And that is worthy to be noted,
nur ’ἐγὼ &bs zum ps 15³vaan thecaptioity, they
compute {lm years only from the kinydom oftlm Greeks. They
said before, “Thatn the Romans, for a hundred and fourscore
years, rulcd over the Jews before the destruction of the Tem-
ple ;” and yet they do not compute the times to that destrue-
tion by the years of the Romans, but by the years of the
Greeks. Let the Jews themselves well consider this, and the
Christians with them, who reckon the Roman for the fourth
monarchy in Daniel.

Therefore that woman that is here spoken of (to reduce all
into a short conclusion) was a Syro-Grecian by nation, a Phoe-
nician in respect of her habitation‚ and from thence called a
woman of Oanaan.

Ver. 26: Τοῖς κυναρίοις· To the cloys] By this title the
Jews, out of spite and contempt, disgraeed the Gentiles,
whose first care it was to hate, to mock, and to curse, all
beside themselves. 0³:³72: 7³7me obn> snm& leeO na-
tions of tlte world [that is, the hoamen] are likened to cloys.
From the common speech of the nation, rather than from his
own sense, our Saviour uses this expression, to whom ¹ the
Gentiles' were not so hateful, and whose custom was to speak
with the vulgar.
