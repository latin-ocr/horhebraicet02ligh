again.' She saith, ⁶ I have no money.' To whom he replied,
‘ But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry him what

spirits and tempests came, and snatched him away out of my
hands? R. Bon saith, What need have we to learn from an
Arabian? Is it not plainly written, ‘ And Lebanon shall fall
before the powerful One ‘?' (Isa. x. 34.) And what follows
after? ‘ A branch shall come out of the root of -Jesse'” (Isa.
xi. Ι).

The Babylonian doctors yield us a confession not very
unlike the former: “ R. Chaninahg saith, After four hundred
years are past from the destruction of the Temple, if any one
shall say to you, ‘Take to thyself for one penny a field worth
a thousand peuce,5 do not take it.” And agaim “ After four
thousand two hundred thirty-and—one years from the creation
of the world, if any shall say to you, ‘Take for a penny a
field worth a thousand pence,' take it not.” The Gloss is,
“ For that is the time of redemption3 and you shall be
brought back to the holy mountain, to the inheritance of your
fathers: why, therefore, should you mispend your penny 32'

You may fetch the reason of this calculation‚ if you are at
leisure‚ out of the tract Sanhedrimh: “The tradition of the
school of Elias, The world is to last six thousand yearS,”&c.
And a little after 3 “ Elias said to Rabh J udah‚ ‘ The world
shall last not less than eighty-five jubilees3 and in the last
jubilee shall the Son of David come.' He saith to him,
‘Whether in the beginning of it, or in the end?7 He answered
him, ⁴ Ι know not.' ‘ WVhether is this whole time to be
finished first, or notZ' He answered him, ‘I know not.’
But Rabh Asher asserts that he answered thus, ‘ Until then
expect him not, but from thence expect him.’” Hear your
own countrymen‚ O J ew, how many centuries of years are
past by and gone from the eighty· fifth jubilee of the world,
that IS, the year 4250 and yet the Messias of youl expectat
tion is not yet come.
