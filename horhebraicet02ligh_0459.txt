fifth hour they eat not leaven, lest perhaps the day bc cloudy‚
and so a mistake arise about the time. Behold‚ you learn
that it is lawful to eat leaxlen on the fourteenth day, to the
end of the fourth hour3 but in the fifth hour it is not to be
used.'’ The same author elsewhereg writes thus5 “The
passover was not to be killed but in the court, where the
other sacrifices were killed. And it was to be killed on the
fourteenth day asternoon, after the dailys sacrifice.''

And now, reader‚ tell me what day the evangelists call
πρώτην ἀζύμων, the first daps of unleavened bread: and whethel
it be any thing probable that the Passover was ever trans-
ferred unto the fifteenth day? Much less is it probable that
Christ this year kept his Passover one day before the Pass-
overs of the Jews.

For the Passover was not to be slain but in the court,
where the other sacrifices were slain, as we heard just now
from Maimonides: and see the rubrioh of bringing in the
lambs into the court, and of slaying them. And then tell
me seriously whether it be credible, that the priests in tho
Temple, against the set decree of the Sanhedrim that year
(as the opinion we contradict imports)‚ would kill Christ's
one, only, single lamb; when by that decree it ought not. to
be killed before to-morrow3 When Christ said to his disciples‚
“ Ye know, that after two days is the Passover;'’ and when
he commanded them, “Go ye, and prepare for us the Pass-
over,'’ it is a wonder they did not reply, “ True, indeed, Sir,
it ought to be after two days ; bnt it is put off this year to a
day later, so that now it is after three days; it is impossible
therefore that we should obey you now, for the priests will
not allow of killing before to-morrow.’'

We have said enough, I suppose, in this matter. But
while I am speaking of the day of the Passover‚ let me add
a few words, although not to the business concerning which
we have been treating3 and they perhaps not unworthy of
our consideration z
