the sabbath, is guilty.” The Gloss there, ‘⁶ ζ’ἲλΠ are a kind
of clean locustS, and are eaten.'' And the Gemara, a little
after3 “ He that hunts locusts in the time of the dew (on the
sabbath) is not guilty.” The Gloss there writes thus3 “ The
locusts in the time of the dew are purblind, so that if you
hunt them at that time they stop their pace.” The Gemara
goes on, “ Eliezer Ben Mabbai saith, ‘ If they go in flocks he
is not guilty.’'’ The Gloss writes, “ If they flock together
in troops, and be, as it were, ready to be taken, he is not
guilty who hunts them even in the time of heat.”

Ver. 13¹¹: Καὶ ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίωυ’ And was with the wild
beasta] He was among the wild beasts, but was not touched
by them. So Adam first before his fall.

Καὶ οἱ ἄγγελοι διηκόνουν αὐτῷ· And mayel-5 ministercd unto
him] Forty days he was tempted by Satan invisibly, and
angels ministered to him visibly. Satan, at last, put on the
appearance of an angel os light, and pretending to wait on
him, as the rest also did, hid his hook of temptation the more
artificially.

Ver. 24: φΗλθες ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς; Art thou come to destroy
us ξ’] Us? Whom? The devils? or those Galileans in the
synagoguess See what the masters0 say: “ In that generation,
in which the Son of David shall come, saith Rabban Gamaliel,
Galilea shall be laid waste, and the Galileans shall wander
from city to city, and shall not obtain mercy.'' If such a re-
port obtained in the nation, the devil thence got a very fit
occasion in this possessed man of affrighting the Galileans
from receiving Christ, because they were to expect nothing
from his coming but devastation.

be excellently well discovered by searching into the distinction
between ΕὉἻΣ and ΕἿἾΞΞ and ΓΠἾἾΨ, to which πόλεις,
