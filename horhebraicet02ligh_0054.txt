It is worthy observing, that, when John urgeth those that
came to his baptism to repent, it is said, that they vvere
baptized, “ confessing their sins :⁹⁵ which was a sign of re-
pentance highly requisite among the Jews, and necessary
for those that were then brought in to the profession of the
Grospe13 that hereby they might openly profess that they
renounced the doctrine of justification by the works of the
law.

It is worthy of observing also, that John said not, “Repent,
and believe the gospel,'' which our Saviour did, Matt. iv. 17,
(and yet John preached the gospel, Mark i. 1, 2, John i. 7) 3
for his office, chiefly, was to make Christ known, who when
he should come was to be the great preacher of the gospel.

Therefore the Baptist doth very properly urge repentance
upon those that looked for the Messias; and the text of the
Gospel used a very proper word to express true and lively
repentance.

“The poor in spirit, theirs is “ Blessed are the poor, for

“The least in the hin-(Jclom qf ‘¹ The least in the hinqdom qs

“ The mysteries of the hinydom “ The mysteries of the Icinqdom

“ Little children, of such is Little children, of such is

And so we have it elsewhere very often. For ΟἾᾯὩ)
Heaven is very usually, in the J ewish dialect, taken for God,
Dan. iv. 23, Mate. xxi, 25, Luke xv, 21, John iii. 27. And,
