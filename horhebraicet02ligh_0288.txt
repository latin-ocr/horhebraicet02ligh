mised fruit, and others had not so; whereas, had they all
been of the same kind, it is likely they would all have had
leaves after the same manner. But when others had lost all
their leaves of the former year by winds and the winter, and
those of the present year were not as yet come out, this kept
its leaves, according to its nature and kind, both summer and
winter. St. Mark, therefore, in that clause, which chiefly
perplexes interpretem, οὐ γὰρ ἧυ καιρὸς σύκων, for the time of
,ἦρε was not yet, doth not strictly and only give the reason
why he found no figS, but gives the reason of the whole
action; namely, why on that mountain which abounded with
fig trees he saw but one that had such leaves3 and being
at a great distance when he saw it, he went to it, expecting
figs only from it. The reason, saith he, was this, ‘⁴ Because
it was not the usual time of figs :⁹³ for had it been so, he
might have gathered figs from the trees about hi1n3 but
since it wasq not, all his expectation was from this, which
seemed to be the kind of nisinun or rw& ΠὊΞ, which never
wanted leaves or figs. For to take an instance in the tree
ΠἸἚΠ ΠἹΞΞί That tree (suppose) bore figs such a summer,
which hung upon the boughs all the following winter3 it
bore others also next summer3 and those, together with the
former, hung on the boughs all this winter too: the third-
summer it bore a third degree, and this summer brought
those of the first bearing to ripeness, and so onwards con-
tinually3 so that it was no time to be found without fruit of
several years. It is less, therefore, to be wondered at, if
that which promised so much fruitfulness by its looks, that
one might have expected from it at least the fruit of two
years, did so far deceive the hopes it had raised, as not to
afford one fig ς if that, I say, should suffer a just punishment
from our Lord, whom it had so much, in appearance, disap-
pointed: an emblem of the punishment that was to be in-
flicted upon the Jews for their spiritual barrenness and
hypocrisy.
