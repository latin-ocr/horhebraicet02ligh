plain also from that which follows3 sor, “ they say to him,
‘ With you at Tiberias there are fig-trees that bear fruit
in one year :’ to which he answers, ‘ Behold, with you at
Zippor there are trees that bear fruit in two years.’ '' Con-
cerning common fig-trees, their ordinary time of putting out
green figs was sufficiently known3 as also the year of tithing
them : but concerning those trees of another sort, which had
ripe fruit only in two or three years, it is no wonder if they
were at a loss in both.

IV. Christ, therefore, came to the tree seeking fruit on it,
although the ordinary time of figs was not yet; because it
was very probable that some sruit might be found there. Of
the present year, indeed, he neither expected nor could
expect any fruit, when it was so far from being the time of
fiqs, καιρὸς σύκων, that it was almost five months off ε and it
may be doubted whether it had yet so much as any leaves
of the present year. [t was now the month Nisan, and that
month was the time of the first putting out of leaves; so
that if the buds of the leaves had just peeped forth, they
were so tender, small, and scarce worth the name of leaves
(for it was but the eleventh day of the month), that to expect
figs of the same year with those leaves had not been only
in vain, but ridiculous. Those words seem to denote some-
thing peculiar, ἔχουσαν φύλλα, leavingt Zeaves; as if the other
trees thereabout had been without leaves, or, at least, had
not such leaves as promised figs. Mark seems to give the
reason why he came rather to that trec than to any other3
namely, because he saw leaves on it, and thereby hoped to
find figs. ‘⁶ For when he saw (saith he) a fig tree afar off
having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing
thereon.” From the leaves he had hopes of figs: these,
therefore, certainly were not the leaves of the present spring,
sor those were hardly so much as in being yet: but they
were either the leaves of the year past, that had hung upon
the tree all winter, or else this tree was of that kind which
had figs and leaves together hanging on it for two or three
years before the fruit grew ripe. And I rather approve of
this latter sense, which both renders the matter itself more
clear, and better solves the difficulties that arise from the
words of Mark. This tree, it seems, had leaves which pro-
