Oh. iv. 23] Emercitat‘e‘ons upon St. Matmezo. 95

VLx When they were met together in the synagogue on
the sabbath-day (for this being observed, there is no need to
speak any thing of the other days), the service being begun,
the minister of the church calls out seven, whomsoever he
pleases to call out, to read the law in their order. F irst, a
priest‚ then a Levite, if they were present3 and after these
five Israelites. Hence it is, O young student in Hebrew
learning, that in some editions of the Hebrew Bible you see
marked in the margin of the Pentateuch, 1. 3772 The priest.
2. ³³³7 Tloe Levite. 3. wdw The third. 4. *37³2* Tkefourm.
5. ἺΠἾὩΠ The fifth. 6. ”ww lee sioeth. 7. ⁸9⁸1& The seveozth .-
—denoting by these words the order of the readers, and mea-
suring out hereby the portion read by each one. Thus, I sup-
pose, Christ was called out by tlte anyel of the charoli of Naza-
reth, Luke iv. 16, and reading according to the custom as a
member of that synagogue.

There is no need to mention that prayers were made pub-
licly by tlce anyel cf the church for the whole congregation,
and that the congregation answered Amen to every prayer:
and it would be too much particularly to enumerate what
those prayers were, ancl to recite them. It is known enough
to all that prayers‚ and reading of the law and the prophetes,
was the chief Y business in the synagogue‚ and that both were
under the care of the anyel qs tlze syozayoyue.

I. There seemed to have been catechizing of boys in
the synagogue. Consider what· that means, 3³³2} Nm. 0³12}
“ Whatz is theprz'vileye os women ‚9 t &num ³2³7 ἾΓἹἾὊΞ ἾἾἾὊΝΞ
This, that their sons read in the synayoyue. ἹΠῚἾἿΞἎ runs:
23:25 Ἦ lect their husbands recite in the school of the doctor-3.
WVhere the Gloss thus, ‘⁶ The boys that were scholars were
wont to be instructed [or to learn] before their master in the
synagogue.”

II. The Taryumz'st‚ or Interpreter‚ who stood by him that
read. in the laW‚ and rendered what was read out of the He-
brew original into the mother-tongue,—sometimes used a
liberty of enlarging himself in paraphrase. Examples of this
we meet with in the Talmud a, and also in the Chaldee para-
phrast himself.
