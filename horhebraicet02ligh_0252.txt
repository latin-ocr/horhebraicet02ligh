reason of the preparation for the sabbath; namely, lest they
should leave the necessaries for the sabbath unfinished, to go
to meet him : “ N er on the sabbaths‚ by reason of labent-'² in
the banquets: that they omit not those feastings and eat-
ingsg which were esteemed so necessary to the sabbath,
whilst they went out to meet Elias.

Let these three observations out of the Glossers upon the-
page cited serve for a conclusion :—

Ver. 1 1 : Καὶ ἀποκαταστήσει πάντα· And he shall restore all
