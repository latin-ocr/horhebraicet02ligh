The reason why the divine wisdom would have the time of
the destruction of Jerusalem so concealed‚ is well known to
itself ς but by men, since the ‘nime of it was unsearchable, the
reason certainly is not easy to be searched. We may conjec-
ture that the time was hid, partly, lest the godly might be
terrified with the sound of it, as 2 Thess. ii. τις partly, that
the ungodly, and those that would be secure, might be taken
in the snares of their own securim, as Matt. xxiv. 38. But
let secret things belong to God.

VER. 3 : Νάρδου πιστικῆς· Of spikenard.] What if I should
render it, nardinum balaninum, nardin of balanus? “ Nardin
consists h of omphacium, balaninum, bulrush, nard, amomum,
myrrh, balsa1n,'' &a And again ⁴¹, “ Myrobalanum is common
to the TroglodyteS, and to Thebais, and to that, part of Ara-
bia which divides Judea from Egypt ; a growing ointment, as
appears by the very name, whereby also is shown that it is the
mast [qlans] of a tree.”

Βάλαυος, as all know, among the Greeks, is ylans, mast, or
an acorn: so also is &DNDD pistaca, among the Talmudists.
There are prescribed by the Talmudists variousk remedies for
various diseases ε among others, this 3 Ὁ ἾΠἿῖῬ {no-12³7

The Arucli saith, “ ΝΡΠΒἛ is the grain of a fruit, which is

The word νάρδου, nard, is Hebrew from the word ἾἾΞ
neracl,· and the word πιστικὴ is Syriac, from the word &pl-50³2
pistaca. So that the ointment might be called unquentum
balaninum, balanino ointment, in the composition of which,
nard and &ps-50³0 mast, or· myrobalano, were the chief ingre-
dients.
