44 Hebraeo ancl Talmudical [Oh. ii. 23.

Hence you have Christ now in his second year at Beth-lehem,
whither J oseph and Mat-y had again betaken themselves with
him, when they had now presented him in the Temple, ac-
cording to the law, being forty days old, Luke ii. 22. And
they had taken care for his education in this place, and not
elsewhere, until he himself, going forth from hence, might
show himself openly the Messias, if they had not been sent
away somewhere else by permission from heaven.

Ver. 23: “On Ναζωραῖος κληθήσεται· He shall be called a
Nazarena] Those things which are brought from Isa. xi.'1
concerning Ἶᾨ Netzer, the Bra-nolu and those things also pro-
duced concerning Samson the Nazarite, a most- noble type of
Christ, have their weight, by no means to be despised. We
add, that Matthew may be understood concerning the out-
ward, humble‚ and mean condition of our Saviour. And that
by the word Ναζωραῖος, Nazarene, he hints his separation and
estranyement from other men, as a despicable person, and un-
worthy of the society of men.

I. Let it be observed, that the evangelist does not cite
some one of the prophets, but all : τὸ ῥηθὲν διὰ τῶν προφητῶν,
“spoken by the prophets.” But now all the prophets, in a
manner, do preach the vile and abject condition of Christ3
none, that his original should be out of Nazareth.

II. David, in his person, speaks thus3 ἱἾῌζἿζζᾩ ‘'D''[i ἾΞἾΌ
Ι was a stranyer to my bremen, Psalm lxix. 9. ⁸

ΙΙΙ. If you derive the word Ναζωραῖος, Nazarene, which
not a few do, from ἾἾΞ AVazir, a Nazirean, that word denotes
not only a separation, dedicated to God, such as that of the
Nazarenes was; but it signifies also the sepamtion of a man
from others, as being unworthy of their society ,· Gen. xlix. 26,
“ They shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of
the head of him t'nat was separate from his brethren.''

Therefore, let us digest the sense of the evangelist by this
paraphrase: J oseph was to depart with Christ to Beth-lehem,
the city of David, or to Jerusalem, the royal city, had not
the fear of Archelaus hindered him. Therefore‚ by the sig-
nification of an angel, he is sent away into Galilee, a very
contemptible country, and into the city Nazareth, a place
of no account: whence, from this very place, and the name
of it, you may observe that fulfilled to a tittle which is so
often dcclared by the prophOtS, that the Messias should be
