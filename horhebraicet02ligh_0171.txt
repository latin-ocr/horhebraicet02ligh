wink of the eye,” &c ΠἾΨὩΨΠ ΓΞ properly signifies,
between the suns: and the manner of speech seems to be
drawn thence, that there are said to be two ΠἾῺῬΨ sun-sem.
Concerning which, read the Glosser upon Maimonidesl.
WVhere thus also Maimonides himself: “ From the time that
the sun sets till the three middle stars appear, it is called
155me ΓΞ between the suns .· and it is a doubt whether that
time be part of the day or of the night. However, they
every where judge of ib ἾἺΞΠΠῙὩ to render the office laeam.
Therefore, between that time they do not light the sabbatical
candle: and whosoever shall do any servile work on the sab-
bath-eve, and in the going out of the sabbath, is bound to
offer a sacrifice for sin.'' So also the Jerusalem Talmudists
in the place last cited τ “ Does one star appear? Certainly, as
yet it is day. Do two? It is doubted whether it. be day.
Do three?² It is night without doubtss'* And a line after3
“ On the sabbath-eve, if any work after one star seen, he is
clear: if afterm two, he is bound to a sacrifice for a trans-
gression; if after three, he is bound to a sacrifice for sin.
Likewise, in the going out of the sabbath, if he do any work
after one star is seen, he is bound to a sacrifice for sin; if
after two, to a sacrifice for transgression : if after three, he is
clear.''

Hence you may see at what time they brought persons
here to Christ to be healed, namely, in the going out of the
sabbath ς, if so be they took care of the canonical hour of the
nation, which is not to be doubted of.

little after, “Rabh saith, If Messias be among the living,
Rabbenu Haccodesh is he.” The Closs is, “If Messias be
of them that are now alive, certainly our holy Rabbi is he,
as being one that carries infirmities,'' &a R. J udah, whom
they called ‘the Holy,’ underwent very many sicknesses (of
