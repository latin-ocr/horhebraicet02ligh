solemn feasts, namely, that of the Beginning of the Year,
that of Expiation, and that of Tabernacles. From this month
also was the beginning of the Jubilee.

VI. It is probable Christ was born at the feast of Taber-
nacleS.

1. So it ariseth exactly to three-and-thirty years and a
half, when 116 died at the feast of the Passover.

2. He sulfilled the typieal equity of the Passover and Pen-
tecost, when, at the Passover, he offered himself for a pass-
over‚ at Pentecost he bestowed the Holy 611061 from heaven,
as at that time the law had been given from heaven. At
that time the first-fruits of the spirit were given by him
(Rom. viii. 23), when the first-fruits of corn had been wont
to be given, Levit. xxiii. 17. It had been a wonder if he had
honoured the third solemnity, namely, the feast of Taber-
nacles‚ with no antitype.

3. The institution of the feast of Tabernacles agrees excel-
lently with the time of Christ's birth. For when Moses went
down from the mount on the tenth day of the mouth Tisia,
declaring that God was appeased, that the people was par-

doned, and that the building of the holy tabernacle was forth- ’

with to be gone in hand with (hitherto hindered by and be-
cause of the golden calf), seeing that G-od now would dwell
among them, and forsake them no more; the Israelites imme-
diately pitch their tents, knowing they were not to depart
from that place before the divine tabernacle was finished, and
they set upon this work with all their strength. Whence the
tenth day of that mouth, wherein Moses came down and
brought this good news with him, was appointed for the feast
of Expiation3 and the fifteenth day, and seven days after, for
the feast of Tabernacles, in memory of their dwelling in tents
in the wildemess, when Grod dwelt in the midst of them:
which things with how aptly typical an aspect they respect
the incarnation, when God dwelt among men in human flesh,
is plain enough.

4. Weigh Zech. xiv. 16, 17: “And it shall come to pass,
that every one that is left of all the nations which came
against Jerusalem shall even go up, from year to year, to
worship the King‚ the Lord of hosts, and to keep the feast os
Tabernacles. And it shall be, that whoso will not come up
