VER. 2: Καὶ μετεμορφώθη’ And was tmusfiqumd] When
Christ was baptized, being now ready to enter upon his evan-
gelica! priesthood, he is sealed by a heavenly voice for the
szk Prie-st, and is anointed with the Holy Spirit, as the high
priests were wont to be with holy oil.

In this transfiguration, he is sealed for the high priest:
for mark, 1. How two of the greatest prophets, Moses and
Elias, resort to him. 2. How to those words, “This is my
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,'' which also were
heard from heaven at his baptism, is added that clause,
“ hear ye him :²² which compare with the words of Moses,
concerning a prophet to be raised up by God, Dent. xviii.
19, “ Whosoever shall not hear-ken to my words, which I
shall put into his mouth,’' 820. 3. How the heavenly voice
went out of the cloud that overshadowed them, when at his
baptism no such cloud appeared. Here that is worthy ob-
serving, which some Jews note, and reason dietates‚ namely‚
That the cloud of glory‚ the conductor of Israel, departed
at the death of Moses; for while he lived, that cloud was the
people’s guide in the wilderness; but when he was dead, the
ark of the covenant led them. Therefom, as that cloud de-
parted at· the death of Moses, that great prophet, so such a
cloud was now present at the sealing of the greatest Prophet.
4. Christ here shines with such a brightneSS, nay, with a
greater than Moses and Elias now glorified3 and this both
for the honour of his person and for the honour of his doc-
trine3 both which surpassed by infinite degrees the persons
and the doctrines of both of them. When you recollect the
face of Christ tmnsfigured, shining with so great lustre when
he talked with Moses and Elias, acknowledge the brightness
of the gospel above the cloudy obsourity of the law and of the
prophet-s.

Ver. 4: Ποιήσωμεν ὧδε τρεῖς σκηνὰς, Sco. Let us make here
three tabernaclea Sym] The transfiguration of Christ was by
night. Compare Luke ix. 37. The form of his face and
garments is changed while he prays3 and Moses and Elias
