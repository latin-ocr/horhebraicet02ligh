he that changeth Ἴ [Deilet'h] into Ἴ [Βο811], destroys the
world

But that our Saviour, by ἰῶτα καὶ κεραία, jot and time, did
not only understand the bare letters, or the little marks that
distinguished them, appears sufficiently from verse 19, where
he renders it, one of “ these least commands:” in which
sense is that also in the Jerusalem Gemara of Solomon's

rooting out J od, that is, evacuating that precept NED] ΝῙ7

ῦἾζῗξ Η6 shall not multiply wives. And yet it appears enough
hence, that our Saviour also so far asserts the uncorrupt im-
mortality and purity of the holy text, that no particle of the
sacred sense should perish, from the beginning of the law to
the end of it.

To him that diligently considers these words of our Saviour‚
their opinion offers itself, who suppose that the whole alphabet
of the law, or rather the original character of it is perished ;
namely‚ the Samaritam, in which they think the law was first
given and written3 and that that Hebrew wherein we now
read the Bible was substituted in its stead. We shall not
expatiate in the question; but let me, with the reader's good
leave, produce and consider some passages of the Talmud‚
whence, if I be not mistaken, Christians seem first to have
taken up this opinion.
