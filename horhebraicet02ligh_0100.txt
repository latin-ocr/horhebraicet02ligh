because they were situated in the fields, where they might be
in danger.'' And so Rabbenu Asherr upon the same tract;
“Anciently their synagogues were in fields: therefore they
were afraid to tarry there, until the evening prayers were
ended. It was therefore appointed that they should recite
some verses, in which a short sum of all the eighteen prayers
had been compacted; after which that prayer ἾΞὊἪ ἹΝἿἾ was
to be recited.’'

But the following times brought back their synagogues for
the most part into the cities 3 and provision was made by
sharp canons, that a synagogue should be built in the highest
place of the city, and that no house should be built higher
than it.

V. The like provision was made, that every one at the
stated times of prayer should frequent the synagogue. “ GrodS
does not refuse the prayers, although sinners are mingled
there. Therefore it is necessary that a man associate himself
with the congregation, and that- he pray not alone when an
opportunity is given of praying with the congregation. Let
every one therefore come morning and evening to the syna-
gogue.'' And “ Itt is forbidden to pass by the synagogue in
the time of prayer, unless a man carry some bui-den upon his
back: or unless there be more synagogues in the same city ;
for then it may be judged that he goes to anot-her; or unless
there be two doors in the synagogue; for it may be judged
that he passed by one to go in at another. But if he carry
his phylacteries upon his head, then it is allowed him to pass
by, because they bear him witness that he is not unmindful
of the law.'' These things are taken out of the Babylonian
Talmudu: where these are also added: “ The holy blessed
one saith, Whosoever employeth himself in the study of the
law, and in the returning of mercy, and whosoever prays with
the synagogue, I account concerning him, as if he redeemed
me and my sons from the nations of the world. And whoso-
ever prays not with the synagogue is called an ⁶ ill neighbour‚'
as it is said, ‘ Thus saith the Lord of all my evil neighbours,' '³
