saith also of the oblations of the congregation, Ye shall do
this to the Lord in your set times, and to them all he pre-
scribes a set time. Every thing, therefore, to which a time
is set, is also offered in uncleanness, if so be very many of the
congregation, or very many of the priests, be unclean.’'

‘⁶ Wea find ¹³ that the congregation makes their Passover

candle. For in the night time all are within their houses,
and a candle is most proper for such a search. Therefore,
they do not appoint employments in the end of the thirteenth
day, nor doth a wise man begin to recite his phylacteries in
that time, lest thereby, by reason of their lengthe, he be
hindered from seeking for leaven in its season.'' And the
