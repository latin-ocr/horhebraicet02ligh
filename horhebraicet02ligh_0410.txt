But you never find J ames called Bwnerqes, or John so called,
either by themselves or by others. We must trust conjecture
for the rest.

IV. It is well enough known what· the phrase ‘9537 n: Bam
Κοῖ, tlte dauylcter qf munder, means among the Jews. Our
Saviour, using another word, seems to respect another ety-
mology of the name. But it is demanded, what that is. He
calls Simon Peter with respect had to the work he was to ply
in building the church of the Gentiles upon a roc-k. For he
first opened the door to let in the gospel among the Gentiles.
Whether were J ames and John called sons of muncler with
respect had to their stout discoursing against the Jews, we
neither dare to say, nor can we deny it. J ames did this, as
it seems, to the loss of his life, Acts xii.

But what if allusion be here made to the two registrars‚ or
scribes of the SanhedrimZ whereof one sat on the right hand,
and the other on the left3 one wrote the votes of those that
acquitted‚ the other the votes of those that condemnedm. Or
to the president himself, and the vice-president? whose defi-
nitive sentence, summing up the votes of the whole Sanhedrim,
was like thunder and lightning to the condemned persons, and
seemed to all like the oracles given from Sinai out of lightning
and thunder.

V. But whatsoever that was in the mind of our Saviour,
that moved him to imprint this name upon them, when these
two brethren, above all the other disciples, would have fire
falln from heaven upon that town of the Samaritans which
refused to give Christ entertainment, Luke ix, 54, they seem
to act according to the sense of this surname. And when the
mother of these desired a place for one of them on Ohrist's
right hand, and for the other on his left, she took the confi-
dence of such a request probably from this, that Christ had
set so honourable a name upon them above the other dis-
ciples. And when John himself calls himself the elder, κατ’
ἔμφασιν, and he was sufficiently known to those to whom he
writ under that bare title, ὁ πρεσβύτερος, the elder-‚s Ι cannot
but suspect this distinguishing character arose hence. All
the apostles‚ indeed, were elders, which Peter saith of himself,
