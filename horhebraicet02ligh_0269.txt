the case of adultery3 he might not, if he had pleased‚ have
brought her to trial by the bitter waters; but it argued the
hardness of his heart towards his wife, or burning jealousy,
that he brought her. I do not remember that I have any-
where in the Jewish pandect read any example of a wife
punished with death for adultery. Therep is mention of
the daughter of a certain priest committing fornication in
her father's house, that was burnt alive3 but she was not
married.

Ver. 13¹: Τότε προσηνέχθη αὐτῷ παιδία· Thea were little
children brouyht mato him] Not for the healing of some
disease; for if this had been the end proponnded, why did
the disciples keep them back above all others, or chide any
for their ειοοθεεὲ Nor can we believe that they were the
children of unbelieving Jews, when it is scarcely probable
that they, despising the doctrine and person of Christ, would
desire his blessing. Some therefore of those that believe
brought their infants to Christ, that he might take parti-
cular notice of them, and admit them into his discipleship‚
and mark them for his by his blessing. Perhaps the dis-
ciples thought this an excess of officious religion; or that
they would be too troublesome to their Master3 and hence
they opposed them: but Christ countenanceth the same
thing, and favours again that doctrine which he had laid
down, cha-p. xviii. 33 namely, that the infants of believers
were as much disciples and partakers of the kingdom of
heaven as their parents.

It is2worthy marking, how again and again in the New Tes-
tament, when mention is made of the whole law, only the
second table is exemplified, as in this place3 so also Rom.
xiii. 8, 9, and James ii. 8, 11, &c. Charity towards our neigh-

bour is the top of religion, and a most undoubted sign of love
towards God.
