Ch. v. 32, 3 3.] Exercitcitions upon St. M atthew. 125

VII. The wife, thus dismissed, might, is she pleased‚ bring
this bill to the Sanhedrim, where it was enrolled among the
records, if she desired it, in memory of the thing. The dis-
missed person likewise might marry whom she would: if the
husband had not put some stop in the bill, by some clause
forbidding it.

Ver. 32: ὸΟς ἂν ἀπολύσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα αὑτοῦ, &Q Wlwsoever
shallput away lais wife, (86] 1. 0111· Saviour does not abrogate
Moses's permission of divorces, but tolerates it, yet keeping it
within the Mosaic bounds, that is, in the case of adultery,
condemning that liberty in the Jewish canons, which allowed
it for any cause.

II. Divorce was not commanded in the case of adultery‚
but permitted. Israelites were compelled, sometimes even
by whipping, to put away their wives, as appears in Maimo-
nidesk. But our Saviour, even in the case of adultery, does
not impose a compulsion to divorce, but indulgeth a license
to do it.

ΙΙΙ. “ Η6 that puts away his wife without the cause of for-
nication makes her commit adultery :⁵³ that is, if she commits
adultery : or although she commit not adultery in act, yet he
is guilty of all the lustful motions of her that 18 put away3
for he that lustfully desires, is said “ to commit adultery,''
ver. 28.

been said by them of 0ch time, Thou skalt not forswear thgyself,
&off The law forbids perjury, Levit. xix. 12, 856. To which
the Fathers of the Traditions reduced the whole sin of swear-
ing, little caring for a rash cath. In this chapter of oaths
they doubly sinned:

Ι. That they were nothing at all solicitous about an oath,
so that what was sworn were not false. They do but little
trouble themselves, what, how, how often, how rashly, you
swear, 80 that what you swear be true.

In the Talmudic tract ΠἸὨἾΞΨ Shevuotlc, and in like man-
ner in Maimonides, oaths are distributed into these four
ranks :
