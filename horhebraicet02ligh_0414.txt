408 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. iv. 1 1.

viour stigmatizeth the Jewish nation with that very name
that they were wont to call the heathens by.

The word :mmm those without, occurs also in the Tal-
mudists, when it signifies the Jews the1nselves3 that is, some
of the Jewish nation. Heref D‘N'Wp the Karmffes, who re-
jected traditions, there ΒἛἾΞἾἻ οἱ ἔξω, those without, are op.-
posed to &³2:1¹7 the ποίεε men .· ‘² He that puts his phylacteries
on his forehead, or in the palm of his hand, ΒἿΝἾΓΛἾ ῬἼ Ἱῗ ‘'W-8
behold! lm follows the custom of the Kar-aites. And he that
overlays one of them with gold, and puts it upon his garment
which is at his hand, ὈὊἾΞἺἾΠ ΤΠ Ἱτ ἾἻΠ behold J he follows
the custom of those that are without. Where the Gloss,
“ ΒΊἸΞἿΠ are men who follow their own will, and not the
judgment of the wise men.” They are supposed to wear phy-
lacteries, and to be Jews3 but when they do according to
their pleasme, and despise the rules of the wise men, they
are esteemed as those that are without, οι· lammens. So was
the whole J ewish nation according to Christ’s censure, which
despised the evangelical wisdom.

Ἐν παραβολαῖς τὰ πάντα γίνεται· All thinys are done in pa·-
rables] Ι. How much is the ,Jewish nation deceived con-
eerning the times of the Messias ! They think his forerunner
Elias will explain all difficulties, resolve scrupleS‚ and will
render all things plain ; so that when the Messias shall come
aster him, there shall be nothing obscure or dark in the law
and in religion. Hence these expressions and the like to
them: “ Oneg found a bill of contracts in his keeping, and
knew not what it meant, vrb& &TW '²537 mm &⁴7³
Let it be laid up till Elias shall come.” And more in the same
tract, concerning things found, when it is not known to whom
they are to be restored, “ Let them be laid up till Elias
come.'' ruvffffl‘v ἹΠἾΚῬΝ vm> Ἶῖ ΠΨἾΞ) ΤΙιατ h passaye, (Ezek.

that sort occur.

But, alas ἱ thou art deceived, O J exv. All things are made
