Oh. xv. 2.] Exercitations upon St. fllatthew. 223

Οὐ γὰρ νίπτονται τὰς χεῖρας αὐτῶν, &c. For they wash ‘not
their hands, &c.] Then undervaluing of the washing of hands
is said to be among those things for which the Sanhedrim
excommunicates: and therefore that R. Eleazar Ben Hazar
was excommunicated by it, 0⁸7³ fulvum: pnpbw because he
undervalued tlte waslrinq of lemzcls; and that when he was
dead, by the command of the Sanhedrim, a great stone was
laid upon his bier. “ Whence you may learn (say they) that
the Sanhedrim stones the very coffiu of every excommunicateo
person that dies in his excommunication.'’

It would require a just volume, and not a short commen-
tary, or a running pen, to lay open this mystery of Phari-
saism concerning washin’g of hands, and to discover it in all
its niceties: let us gather these few passages out of infinite
numbers :

I. ΒἾἾΞἾΕ) *Tm 31737’2203 2:³ss nlvvl Tlcep waslzz‘ny of
hands aad the plunyiny of them is appointed by the words of the
scribes : but by whom, and when, it is doubted. Some ascribe
the institution of this rite to Hillel and Shammai‚ others carry
it back to ages before them: “ H illelq and Shammai decreed
concerning the washing of hands. R. J osi Ben Rabbi Bon, in
the name of R. Levi, saith, ‘ That tradition was given before,
but they had forgotten it ε’ these second stand forth, and ap-
point according to the mind of the f01·mer.”

ΙΙ. “ Althoughr it was permitted to eat unclean meats,
and to drink unclean drinks, yet the ancient religious eat
their common food in cleanness, and took care to avoid un-
cleanness all their days; and they were called Pharisees.
And this is a matter of the highest sanctity, and the way of
the highest religion; name-ly, that a man separate himself,
and go aside from the vulgar, and that he neither touch
them, nor eat nor drink with them: for such separation
conduceth to the purity of the body from evil works,” &c.
Hence that definition of a Pharisee which we have produced
before, rivus: ΓῘὮἾΠ ΓῙῬΣἾΝ) ΓΨἸἾΞ The Pharaeos eat their
common food in eleamzess : and the Pliarisaical ladder of
heaven, ‘⁴ W hosoeverS hath his seat in the land of Israel,
