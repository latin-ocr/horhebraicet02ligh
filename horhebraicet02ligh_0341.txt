Ch. xxvi. 6.] Jdaeercitations upon St. sslatlhew. 335

Passover, indeed, not seldom signifies the lamb itself ; some-
times the very time of eating the lamb3 sometimes the sa-
crifice of the day following, as John xviii. 28. But ἑορτὴ τοῦ
Πάσχα, tlte feast of tlee Passover, alway signifies the whole
seven days' paschal feast, both in the language of the Scrip-
ture and of the Talmudists: a J ew would laugh at one that
should interpret it otherways.

2. When Christ said to. Judas going out, “ What thou
doest, do quickly,” some thought he meant this, “ Buy those
things that we have need of against the feast,'' at the twenty-
ninth verse. For what feast, I pray3 sor the paschal supper?
That, according to the interpreters which we here oppose,
was just past. For the remaining part of the feast of that
solemnity? Alas, how·11nseasonable1 Where were those things,
I pray, then to be bought, if this were the very night on which
they had just eaten the lamb? The night of a feast day was
festival: where were there any such markets to be found then?
It was an unusual thing indeed, and unheard of, to rise from
the paschal supper to go to market: a market on a festival-
nightS was unusual and unheard of. It would argue some ne-
gligence‚ and a little good husbandry, if those things that were
necessary for the feast were not yet provided ; but that they must
be to run, now late at night, to buy those things they knew
not where, they knew not how. It is certainly very harsh, and
contrary to reason, to understand these things thus, when,
from the first verse, the sense is very plain, before tlce feast of
the Passover. The Passover was not yet come, but was near
at hand : the disciples, therefore, thought that our Saviour had
given order to J udas to provide all those things that were ne-
cessary to the paschal solemnity against it came.

3. Observe that also of Luke, chap. xxii. 3, &ez ‘⁶ Satan
entered into Judas, and he went his way, and communed
with the chief priestS,'’ διο. And after, in the seventh verse,
“ 'I'hen¹ came the day of unleavened bread.” Hence Ι inquire,
Is the method of Luke direct 01· no? If not, let there be
some reason given of the transposition; if it be direct, then
it is plain that the devil entered into J udas before the Pass-
over: but he entered into him at that supper in John xiii. 27;
therefore that supper was before the Passover. For,
