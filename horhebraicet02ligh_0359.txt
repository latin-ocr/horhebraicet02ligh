Ch. xxvi. 27.] Eaeercitaresons upon St. Mattlme. 353

It must not be passed by, that when he instituted the eu-
charisticalx cup, he said, ‘⁴ This is my blood of the new
testamen& as Matthew and Mark : nay, as Luke and Paul,
“ This cup is the new testament in my blood.'' Not only
the seal of the covenant, but the sanction of the new cove-
nant: the end of the Mosaical economy, and the confirming
of a new one. The confirmation of the old covenant was
by the blood of bulls and goats, Exod. xxiv„ Heb. ix„ be-
cause blood was still to be shed: the confirmation of the
new was by a cup of wine3 because, under the new testa-
ment, there was no further shedding of blood. As it is
here said of the cup, ⁴⁴ This cup is the new testament in my
blood,” so it might be said of the cup of blood (Exod. xxiv. 8),
‘⁶ That cup was the old testament in the blood of Christ-„³²
There, all the articles of that covenant being read over,
Moses sprinkled all the people with blood, and said, “ This is
the blood of the eovenant which God hath made with you :''
and thus that old covenant or testimony was confirmed. In
like manner, Christ having published all the articles of the
new covenant, he takes the cup of wine, and gives them to
drink, and saith, “ This is the new testament in my blood :’'
and thus the new covenant is established.

There was, besides, a fourth cup, of which our author
speaks also; ‘⁴ Then he mingled a fourth cup, and over it
he finished the Hallel,· and adds, moreover‚ tlae blessiny qf
the hymn, ἾἾΗΠ ΓΌἾΞ which is, ⁶ Let all thy works praise
thee, O Lord‚' &c 3 and saith, ‘ Blessed is He that created
the fruit of the vine ;’ and afterward he tastes of nothing
more that night,’⁷ ao. ‘ Finisheth the Hallel ‚·’ that is, he
begins there where he left off before, to wit, at the beginning
of Psalm cxv„ and goes on to the end of Psalm cxviii.

VVhether Christ made use of this cup also, we do not
dispute ; it is certain he used the hymn, as the evangelist
tells us, ’ὑμνήσαντες, when they had suny a hymn, at the
thirtieth verse. We meet with the very same word pawn
in Midras Tillim y. ,

And now looking back on this paschal supper, let me
ask those who suppose the supper in John xiii. to be the
