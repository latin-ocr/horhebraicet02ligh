Acts iv. 36, Βαρνάβας, ὅ ἐστιν, υἱὸς παρακλήσεως· Barnabas,
wlciolc is, A son of consolation.

ΙΙ. Bar Timaz' may be rendered otherwise than the son of
Timoeus: namely, eit-her ΠὩἿΠ Ὃ, α son of admimtiom or,
which is more proper, 'Um w: a son ofprofit. The Targum

in Esther iii. 8; ῘἾΠΠῸ ἾῚΞἺΔ ΠἻῙῚ ,ΠἻῖῬ ΝΞίὩὩῖἳἹ To tlte '752‘an
arfisetlc wo profit (‘Tz‘mai') from them. The evangelist there-
fore, deservedly, that 116 might shew that this Barcimceus was
not named from this, or that, or some other etymology, but
from his father's name, so interprets his name, Βαρτιμαῖος, υἱὸς

among the Jews.

the Chaldeans? 60 that Bartimoeus the son of Timoeus might
sound no more than the blind son osa blind father.

other evangelists eoneerning the time of casting out the mer-
ohants of the Temple, and it will appear that the word περι-
βλεψάμενος, he Zooked about, denotes not a bare beholding or
looking upon, but a beholding with reproof and eorrecti0n3

Ver. 13: Οὐ γὰρ ἣν καιρὸς σύκων· For the time offiys was
