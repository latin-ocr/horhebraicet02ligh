man3 ‘ Why do all receive benefit and comfort from Christ,
but only 13⁹ Perhaps he laboured under that dim—sighted-
ness which the disciples of Christ and the whole nation did
concerning his earthly kingdom, victories, and triumphs :
from which how distant (alas Ξ) was this, that his forerunner
and the chief minister should lie in chains 2 ‘ If thou art he,
concerning whose triumphing the prophets declare so much,

some, which, indeed, in respect of office, are much less than
he in the kingdom of heaven, or in the commonwealth of
Christ, who yet are greater than he in respect of the know-
ledge of the state and condition of his kingdom.'’ A com-
parison certainly is not here made, either in respect of office,
or in respect of dignity, or in respect of holiness, or in respect
