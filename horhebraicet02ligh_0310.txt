sake]; ‘would you have me (lestroy allss' Then it was quiet,
and did not bubble any more?³ &a

The truth of this story we leave to the relators: that
which makes to our present purpose we observe: that it
was very improbable, nay, next to impossible, that those that
heard the words of Christ (concerning Zacharias slain before
the Temple and the altar) could understand it of any other
but of this, concerning whom and whose blood they had such
famous and signal memory; and of any other Zacharias slain
in the Temple there was a profound silence, In J osephus,
indeed, we meet with the mention of one Zacharias, the son
of Bamch, <which is the same thing with Barachias‚) killed in
the Temple, not longf before the destruction of it: whom
some conjecture to be prophetically marked out here by our
Saviour: but· this is somewhat hard, when Christ expressly
speaks of time past, ἐφονεύσατε, ye slew,· and when, by no art
nor arguments, it can be proved that this Zacharias ought to
bc reckoned into the number of prophets and martyrs.

There are two things here that stick with interpreters, so
that they cannot so freely subscribe to our Zacharias: 1. That
he lived and died long before the first Temple was destroyed;
when the example would have seemed more home and proper
to be taken under the second Temple, and that now near
expiring. 2. That he was plainly and notoriously the son
of Jekoiada; but this is called by Christ “the son of ,Βανα-
ahias?

To which we, after others who have discoursed at large
upon this matter, return only thus much:

Ι. That Christ plainly intended to bring examples out of
the Old Testament; and he brought two, which how much
the further off they seemed to be from deriving⁰any guilt to
this generation, so much heavier the guilt is if they do derive
it. For a J ew would argue, “ What hath a ch to do with
the blood os Abel, killed almost two thousand years before
Abraham the father of the Jews was born? And what hath
this generation to do with the blood of Zacharias, which was
expiated by cruel plaguesg and calamities many ages since 3’'
Nay, saith Christ, this yeneration hath arrived to that degree
