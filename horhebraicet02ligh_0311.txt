of impiety‚ wickedness, and guilt, that even these remote
examples of guilt relate, and are to be applied to it: and
while you think that tho blood of Abel, and the following
martyrs doth nothing concern you, and believe that the blood
of Zacharias hath been long ago expiated with a signal
punishment3 I say unto yOU, that the blood both of the one
and the other, and of all the righteous men killed 111 the in-
terval of time between them, shall be required of this yene-
ration‚· 1. Because you kill him who is of more value than
they all. 2. Because by your wickedness you so much kindle
the anger of God, that he is driven to cut off his old church;
namely, the people that hath been of a long time in covenant
with him.r For when Christ saith, T hat on ²isoio may come aa
the rifyhteoas blood, &c.; it is not so much to be understood
of their personal guilt. as to that blood, as of their guilt for
the killing of Christ, in whose death, the guilt of the murder
of all those his types and members is in some measure
included: and it is to be understood of the horrible de-
struction of that generat-ion, than which no former ages have
ever seen any more woful or amazing, nor shall any future,
before the funeral of the world itself. As if all the guilt
of the blood of righteous men, that had been shed from
the beginning of the world, had flowed together upon that
generation.

II. To the second, which has more difficulty, namely‚ that
Zacharias is here called the son of Barachias, when he was
the son of Jehoiada, we will observe, by the way, these two
things out of the writings of the J ews, before we come to
determine the thing itself:

1. That that very Zacharias of whom we speak is by the
. Chaldee paraphrast called the son of Iddo. For thus saith
110 011 Lament. iii. 20: “ ‘Is it fit that the daughters of
Israel should eat the fruit of their wome' &css The rule
of justice answered and said, ⁶ Is it also fit that they should
slay a priest and prophet in the Temple of the Lord, as ye
slew Zacharias the son of Idolo, the high priest and faithful
prophet, in the house of the Sanctuary, on the day of vEx-
piation ζ’ ’' &Q
