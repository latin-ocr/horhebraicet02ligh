Ver. 27 ι Οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἔκβάλλουσι; By whom do your
children cast them out ἓ] By your children, Christ seems to
understand some disciples of the Pharisees 3 that is, some of
the Jews, who using exorcisms seemed to cast out devils
such as they, Acts xix. 13³; and yet they said not to them,
“ Ye cast out devils by Beelzebul.'' It is worthy marking,
that Christ presently saith, “If I by the Spirit of Grod cast
out devils, then the kingdom of God is come among you.''
For what else does this speak‚ than that Christ was the first
who should cast out devils? which was an undoubted sign
to them that the kingdom of heaven was now come. But
that which was performed by them by exorcisms was not so
much a casting out of devils, as a delusion of the people ς
since Satan would not cast out Satan, but by compaet with
himself and with his company he seemed to be cast out,
that he might the more deceive.

The sense, therefore, of Christ's words comes to this:
‘⁶ That your disciples cast out devils, ye attribute not to Beel-
zebul, no nor to magic3 but ye applaud the work when it is
done by them: they, therefore, may in this matter be your
judges, that you pronounce these words of my actions out of
the rankness and venom of your minds.”

ἐν τῷ μέλλοντι· It shall not be ιίόνςιὶυεη kim, neither in this world,
ozor in that which is to coma] They that endeavour hence to
prove the remission of some sins after death, seem little to
understand to what Christ had respect when he spake these
words. Weigh well this common and most known doctrine
of the J ewish schools, and judge :

“ Hec that transgresses an affirmative precept, if he pre-
sently repent, is not moved until the Lord pardon him. And
