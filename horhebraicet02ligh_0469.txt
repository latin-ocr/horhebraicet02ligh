to the nature and quality of the feast, which was a monument
of release.

The words ΝἺΝΏ and 7¹³3), here and there used by the
Syrian and the Arabio for feast, and especially ἾΨ, remind
me of that disputation of the Gemarists upon the second
word in the tract Acodah ΖαναῘις namely‚ whether it be to
be writ ῙΠἿἾἾΝ or ΓΠἾἻἾΏ, whereby is denoted a feast day of
the heathens.

Ver. 7: Βαραββᾶς· Βαναόὂαε.] Let us mention also with
him a very famous rogue in the TalmudistS, ἾΝΓἾ l: Ben
Dinon} whose name also was Eleazar. Of whom they have
this passage worthy of chronological observation 3 “ Fromk
the time that murderers were multiplied, the beheading the
red cow ceased; namely, from the time that Eleazar Ben
Dinai came3 who was also called Techinnah Ben Perishah:
but again they called him, ἶΠΞἻΠ l: lee son (gf α murderer.”
Of him mention is made elsewherel, where it is written
ΝΞἹἾ 32 Bon Domai. See also ἾΞΞ l: Ben Nezer, the king
of the robbersm.

Ver. 21 : Ἐρχόμενον ἀπ’ ἀγροῦ· Cominy out of the country, οι·
field] ’ἶ ΠἻἮΠ VD 0³23> ΒἿΝἾΞὩ “ T beyn briny wood out of
the field [on a feast—day} either bound together, or ἣΞἾρΠ 12
from some place fauced round or scattered.” The Gloss there
is3 “ They bring wood on a feast day out of the field, which
is within the limits of the sabbath, if it be bound together on
the eve of the feast-day, &02 ηὓῆρ is a place watched and
senced in every way.'’ And Rambam writes, “ Rabbi Jose
saith, If there be a door in ῆΞἾΡ such a fencedplace, although
it be distant from the city almost two thousand cubits, which
are the limits of the sabbath, one may bring wood thence.”

It may be conceived, that Simon the Gyrenean came out of
the field thus loaded with wood3 and you may conceive that
he had given occasion⁰ to the soldiers or executioners, why
they would lay the cross upon him, namely, because they saw
’ that he was a strong bearer; and instead of one burden‚ they
laid this other upon him to bear.
