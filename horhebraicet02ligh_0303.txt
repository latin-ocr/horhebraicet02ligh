Oh. xxiii. 16.] Evewitatimzs upon St. Mamaea«. 297

Yet in making of these they used their utmost endeavours
for the sake of their own gain, that they might- some way or
other drain their purses, after they had drawn them in
under the showb of religion, or make some use or benefit
to themselves by them. The same covetousness, therefore,
under a veil of hypocrisy, in devouring widows' houses, which
our Saviour had condemned in the former clause, he here also
condemns in hunting after proselyles; which the scribes and
Pharisees were at all kind of pains to bring over to them.
Not that they cared for proselytes, whom they accounted as
“ a scab and plague 3⁹³ but that the more they could draw
over to their religion, the greater draught they should have
for gain, and the more purses to fish in. These, therefore,
being so proselyted, ‘⁶ they made doubly more the children
of hell than themselves.'’ For when they had drawn them
into their net, having got their prey, they were no further
concerned what became of them, so they got some benefit by
them. They might perish in ignorance, superstition, atheism,
and all kind of wickedness: this was no matter of concern
to the scribes and Pharisees; only let them remain in Ju-
daiffin, that they might lord it over their consciences and
purses.

Whosoever shall sec-ear by the yold of the Temple, he 'is a demon]

Gorban, chap. xv. 5. W e must not understand the ⁸(10ch of
the Temple here, of that gold which shined all about in the
walls and ceilings 3 but the gold here meant is that which
was ,offered up in the forban. It was a common thing with
them, and esteemed as nothing, to swear ΓΠΠ ΓΨὮΠ by the
Temple, and mmm-5 by the altar, which we have observed at
the 31st verse of the fifth chapter: and therefore they
thought themselves not much obliged by it3 but if they
swore 1:337 Cor-bom, they supposed they were bound by an in-
dispensable tie. For example : if any one should swear thus,
⁴ By the Temple, or, By the altar, my money, my cattle, my
goodsc shall not profit you ;’ it was lawfuL nevertheleSS, for
the swearer, if he pleased, to suffer them to be profited by
