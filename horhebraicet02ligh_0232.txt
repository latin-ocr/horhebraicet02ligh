Aa son is bound to provide lais father meat and drink, to clotho
him, to cover· him, to lead kim in and out, to waskfiis face,
hands, and feet. Yea, thatb goes higher, “ Α son is bound to
nourish his father, yea, to beg for him.” Therefore it is no
wonder if these things which are spoken by our Saviour are
not found verbatim in the Jewish pandect3 for they are not
so much alleged by him to shew that it was their direct
design to banish away all reverence and love towards parents,
as to show how wicked their traditione were, and into what
ungodly consequences they ostentimes fell. They denied not di-
rectly the nourishment of their parents, nay, they commanded
it, they exhorted to it3 but consequently by this tradition
they made all void. They taught openly, indeed, that a
father was to be made no account of in comparison of* a
Rabbin that taught them the lawc; but they by no means
openly asserted that parents were to be neglected: yet
openly enough they did by consequence drawn from this
foolish and impious tradition.

is of vows and oaths; and the phrase which is before us
speaks a vow or a form of swearing.

devoted to holy uses, namely, to the use of the altar or the
Temple: as when a man, by a vow, would dedicate this or
