IV, That the baptism of John was by plunging the body
(after the same manner as the washing of unclean persons,
and the baptism of proselytes was), seems to appear from
those things which are related of him 3 namely, that he
“ baptized in Jordan 3⁵³ that he baptized “in AEnon, because
there was much water there ;” and that Christ, being bap-
tized, “came up out of the water :²² to which that seems to
be parallel, Acts viii. 38, “ Philip and the eunuch went down
into the water,” &a Some complain, that this rite is not
retained in the Christian church‚ as though it something
derogated from the truth of baptism, or as though it were
to be called an innovation‚ when the sprinkling of water is
used instead of plunging. This is no place to dispute of these
things Let us return these three things only for a present
answerz—

1. That the notion of washing in J ohn’s baptism differs
from ours, in that he baptized none who were not brought
over from one religion, and that an irreligious one toa-into
another, and that a true one. But there is no place for this
among us who are born Christians: the- condition, therefore,
being varied, the rite is not only lawfussy, but deservedly,
varied also. Our baptism argues defilement, indeed, and un-
cleanness3 and demonstrates this doctrinally,—that we, being
polluted, have need of washing: but this is to be understood
of our natural and sinful stain, to be washed away by the
blood of Christ and the grace of God: with which stain, in-
deed, they were defiled who were baptized by John. But to
denote this washing by a sacramental sign, the sprinkling of
water is as sufficient- as the dipping into water,—when‚ in
truth, this argues washing and purification as well as that.
But those who were baptized by John were blemished with
another stain, and that an outward one, and after a manner
visible 3 that is, a polluted religion,——namely, Judaism, or
heathenism3 from which, if, according to the custom of the
nation, they passed by a deeper and severer washing,—-they
neither underwent it without reason3 nor with any reason
may it be laid upon us, whose condition is different from
theirs.

2. Since dipping was a rite used only in the J ewish nation
and proper to it, it were something hard, if all nations should
