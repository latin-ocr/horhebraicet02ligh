warlike design, he dissembles likewise that he sent his army
to a certain place3 and that he had turned aside thither
to worship eod, and to inquire of the event3 that he had
brought but a very few of his most trusty servants along

lwith him, for whom, being an hungred, he asketh a few
caves.

hearken to Kimohi, producing the opinion of the ancients
concerning this story in these words: “ Our Rabbins, of
blessed memory, say, that he gave him the show· bread, &a
The interpretation also of the clause, &7537 mm Ὁ ῆζζὲἸ

is this31t1s a small thing to say, that it is lawful for us to
eat these loaves taken from before the Lord when we are
hungry; for it would be lawiul to eat this very loaf which
is now set on, which is also sanctified in the vessel (for the
table sanctifieth); it would be lawful to eat even this, when
another loaf is not present with you to give us, and we are
so hunger-bitten.” And a little after3 “There ism nothing
which may hinder taking care of life, beside idolatry‚ adultery‚
and mu1·der.”

These words do excellently agree with the force of our
Saviour's arguments; but with the genuine sense of that
clause, methinks they do not well agree. I should, under
correction, render it otherwise, only prefacing this before-
hand‚ that it is no improbable conjecture that David came
to Nob either on the sabbath itself, or when the sabbath
was but newly gone. ‘⁶ For¹¹ the show-bread was not to be
eaten unless for one day and one night; that is, on the sab-
bath and the going-out of the sabbath3 David, therefore,
came thither in the going-out of the sabbath.’‘' And now I
render David⁵s words thus; “ Women have been kept from
us these three days,” [so that there is no uncleanness with
us from the touch of a menstruous woman],‘ aud the vessels
of the young men were holy, even in the common way} '[that
is, while we travelled 1n the common manner and joui-3ney]

‘·‘·the1ef01e‚ much more are they holy as to their vessels this
[sabbath] day.’' And to this sense perhaps does that come:
