132 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. v. 41 .

blow or wound given: a mulct for the cure of the wound or
blow; a mulct for the reproacb brought upon him: and a
mulct for ceasinq, when, being wounded or beaten, he kept his
bed, and could not follow his business,

To the first, the first words of our Saviour, Μὴ ἀντιστῆναι
τῷ πονηρῷ, That ye resist not evil, seem to relate: Do not so
resist or rise up against an injurious person, as to require the
law of retaliation against him. The second and fourth, the
words following seem to respect, viZ. ‘'Offroe σε ῥαπίσει, ‘ Who-
soever smitam thee, so that it cause pain and shame :’ and
those words also, Θέλοντι χιτῶνά σου λαβεῖν, Him that will take
away thy θοαί) To the last do these words under our hand
refer, and to the second certainly, if “ some intolerable kind
of service be propounded,” which the famous Beza asserts.

The word D'lWLs'H, very usual among the Talmudists, where-
by r they denote accompanying him that goes elsewhere,
out of honour and respect, reaches not the sense of the
word ἀγγαρεύειν, but is too soft and low for it. It is reck-
oned for a duty to accompany a dead corpse to the grave,
and a Rabbin departing somewhere. Hence is that story,
’“ Germani S, the servant of R. Judah Nasi, willing προπέμψαι
(ΠἾἾἹῖὩἿΌ) to conduct R. Illa going away, met a mad dog,'' &c-
The footsteps of this civility we meet with among the Christ-
ians, Tit. iii. 133 John, Ep. iii. ver. 6; they were marks of
respect, love, and reverence ε but that which was required by
the Jewish masters, out of arrogance and a supercilious au-
thority, was to be done to a Rabbin, as a Rabbin.

But ἆγαρρεύειν, to compel to go a mile, sounds harsher,
and speaks not so much an impulse of duty, as a compulsion
of violence: and the Talmudists retain that very word wem&
Anyaria, and do show, by examples not a few, what it means.
“ Itt is reported of R. Eliazar Ben Harsum, that his father
bequeathed him a thousand cities on the dry land, and a
thousand ships on the sea: but yet he, every day carrying
along with him a bottle of meal on his shoulder, travelled
from city to city, and from country to country, to learn the
laW. On a certain day his servants met him, &⁸5:1th '22 'amm
and aozyariate, compel him. He saith to them, ‘I beseech you,
