fame, our Saviour himself setting a value upon the thing
above all the gifts of them that offered.

VER. 3 : Εἰς τὸ ὅρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν κατέναντι τοῦ ἱεροῦ· Upon Nm
mount of Olives, over ayaiwst the Templa] “ The eastm gate
of the Court of the Gentiles had the metropolis Sushan
painted on it. And through this gate the high priest went
out to burn the red cow.'’ And, ‘³ All¹¹ the walls of that
court were high, except the east wall; because of the priest,

disturbing one another, ΠἺΖΠΞ ‘712⁷ *³7:147 1752 then expect?
thefootsteps of the Blessiah. And know that this is true from
hence, that so it was in the days of Abraham; for kingdoms
disturbed one another, and then came redemption to Abra-
ham.’' And elsewhere3 “Sor they came against Abraham,
and so they shall come with Gog and Magog.” And again,
