iniquity is upon hims.q ‘ Shall be utterly cut off 3’ namely,
in this world. ⁶ His iniquity is upon him :' when? Is it not
in the world to come 3” I have quoted this, rather than the
others which are to be found in the same place 3 because
they seem here 10 tax the Samaritam text of corruption;
when, indeed, both the text and the version, as may easily
be< observed, agree very well with the HebreW. When,
therefore, the Rabbin saith, that they have corrupted their
law (ΞΒΠἿῚΠ ΞΠΞἾἾ), 110 doth not so much deny the purity
of the text, as reprove the vanity of the interpretation : as if
he had said, “ Y ou interpret your law falsely, when you do
not infer the resurrection from those words which speak it
so plainly.''

With the present argument of our Saviour compare, first,
those things which are said by R. TanchumS: “ R. Simeon
Ben Jochai saith, God, holy and blessed, doth not join his
name to 1101)] 111011 while they live, but only after their
death, as it is said, ‘Tot the 81111118 111111 are in the eal th
WVhen are they saints? WVhen they are laid m the earth3 for
while they live, God doth not join his name to 1110111; because
he is not sure but that some evil affection may lead them
astray: but when they are dead, then he joins his name to
them. But we find that God joined his name to Isaac while
he was living: ‘ I am the God of Abraham and theu God of
Isaacxss The Rabbins answer, He looked on his (lust as if it
were gathered upon the altar. R. Berachiah said, Since he
became blind, he was in a manner dead.'' See also R. Mena-
hem on the Lawy.

Compare also those words of the Jerusalem Gemaraz: “ The
righteous, even in death, are said to live3 and the wicked,
even in life, are said to be dead. But how' 1s it proved that
the wicked, even in life, are said to be dead? From that
place where it is said, ΗΕΓ] ΠἹῸΞ ΫἾΞΠζξΞ {42³7 Ι have no
deliyht in the death of the dead. Is he already dead, that is
already here called ΠὮ dead. 9 And whence 1s it proved that
the righteous, even in death, are said to live? From that
passage, ‘ Anda he said to him, This is the land, concerning
