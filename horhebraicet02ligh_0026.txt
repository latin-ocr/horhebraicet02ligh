20 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. i. 23.

1. That, in the synagogues‚ when the law and the pro-
phets were read in the original HebreW‚ an interpreter was
always present to the reader, who rendered into the mother-
tongue that which was read, that it might be understood by
the common people. Hence0 those rules of the office of an
nterpreter, and of some places which were not to be ren-
dered into the mother-tongue.

2. That Jonathan the son of Uzziel, a scholar of Hillel,
about the time of Christ's birth, rendered all the prophets
(that is, as the Jews number them, Joshua, Judges‚ Samuel,
the Books of the Kings, Isaiah‚ Jeremiah, Ezekiel‚ and the
twelve lesser prophets) into the Ohaldee languag03 that is,
into a language much more known to the people than the
HebreW, and more acceptable than the mother-tongue. For
if it be asked why he translated them at all, and why he
translated not rather into the mother-tongue, which was
known to all? and if it be objected concerning St. Matthew
and St. Paul, that⁷ writing to the Jews, one his GospeL the
other his Epistle (to the Hem-emp), they must have written
in the Syriae tongue (it¹ so be they wrote not in Hebrew),
that they might be understood by all :—we answer‚

First, It was not without reason that the paraphrast
Jonathan translated out of the Hebrew original into the
Chaldee tongue, because this tongue was much more known
and familiar to all the people than the Hebrew. The holy
text had need of an interpreter into a more known tongue,
because it was now in a tongue not known at all to the vul-
gar. For none knew the Hebrew but such as learned it by
study. However‚ therefore, all the Jews inhabiting the
land of Canaan, did not so readily understand the Chaldee
language as the Syriam, which was their mother-language‚
yet they much more readily understood that than the He-
brew, which, to the unlearned‚ was not known at all. Hence
it was not without necessity that the prophets were turned
into the Chaldee language by Jonathan, and the laW, not
much after, by Onkeios, that they might· a little be under-
stood by the common people, by whom the Hebrew original
was not understood at all. Weq read also that the Book
