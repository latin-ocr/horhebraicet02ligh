mudists thre bench, or the coancil of tlte chief priest, alluding
to the words of the lawgiver‚ Deut. xvii. 9, where the word
priests denutes the inferior councils, and jud-sse the chief
council.

II. In the chief councss, the president sat in the highest
seat, (being at this time, when Christ was under exanflnation,
Rabban Gamaliel, as we said); but the high priest excelled
him in dignity everywhere: for the president of the council
was chosen not so much for his quality, as for his learning
and skill in traditions. He was ³7:3⁷2 (a phrase very much
used by the author of ιῙῑισΙισιδίη, applied to presidente), that
is, keepemflztlcer, and deliverer of tradz'te'ons,· and he was chosen
to this office, who was fittest for these things. Memorable
is the story of Hillel’s coming to the presidentship, being
preferred to the chair for this only thing, because he solved
some doubts about the Passover, having learned it, as he saith
himself, from Shemaiah and Abtalion. We will not think it
much to transcribe the storyP: “The sons of Betira once
forgot a tradit-ion: for when the fourteenth day [on which
the Passover was to be celebrated] fell out on the sabbath,
they could not tell whether the Passover should take place of
the sabbath or no. But they said, There is here a certain
Babyloniam, Hillel by name, who was brought up under
Shemaiah and Abtalion 3 he can resolve us whether the Pass-
over should take place of the sabbath or no. They sent
therefore for him, and said to him, ‘ Have you ever heard in

“ your life, [that is, have you received any tradition‚] whether,

when the fourteenth day falls on the sabbath, the Passover
should take place of the sabbath or 1103’ He answered,
‘ Have we but one Passover that takes place of the sabbath
yearly? or are there not many Passovers that put by the
sabbath yearly? namely, the continual sacrifice.' He proved
this by arguments α pari, from the equality of it, from the
less to the greater, &c But they did not admit of this from
him, till he said, ‘ May it thus and thus happen to me, if Ι
did not hear this of Shemaiah and Abtalion.’ When they
heard this they immediately submitted, and promoted him to
the p1·esidentship‚” &c.
