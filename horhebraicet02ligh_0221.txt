before the death of Christ. Which being observed, the sense
of the apostle will more easily appear, Rom. xi. 8 ; where these
very words are repeated. If you there state aright the rejec-
tion of that people‚ you will understand more clearly the apo-
stle concerning their call, which is there handled. Pharisaism
and the sottishness of traditions had, now a good while ago,
thrown them into blindness, stupidity, and hardness of heart;
and that for some ages before Christ was born : but when the
gospel came, the Lord had his gleanings among them, and
there were some that believed, and unto whom the participa-
tion of the promises was granted : concerning them the apostle
speaks in that chapter: see ver. 5, ’Ev τῷ νῦν καίρῳ λεῖμμα κατ’

wheat; but all of it was sown with wheat, one or the other.
These words do not so barely mean good and bad men, as
good and bad Christians3 both distinguished from other men,
namely, from heathenS, as wheat is distinguished from other
seeds: but they are distinguished also among themselves, as
good wheat is distinguished from that which is degenerate.
So chap. xxv, all those ten women, expecting the bride-
groom, are virgins; but are distinguished into wise and
foolish.
