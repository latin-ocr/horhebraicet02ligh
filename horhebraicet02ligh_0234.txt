228 Η ebrew (md Talmuclical [Oh. xv. 5.

Oorbom, or δῶρον, α qast, by whatsoever thou mayest be pro-
fited by me.”

Which words that they may be more clearly understood,
and that the plain and full sense of the place may be dis-
covered, let these things be considered ε

First, That the word ὃῶρου is rather to be rendered, Let it
be α fflfl, than It is α 92th. For Konem and Gorban, as we have
noted, signified not ΚΖΠΡΠΞ ΠἾΠ ‘It ὦς’ ας something) devoted, but
umori: NH* ‘Lat it be’ as somethinq devoted. And he, of whom
we had mention before, who said, mmm Ἶὶκξζυ {vr} 03⁸¹?
meant not, Tlae wine which I shall laste is as something] de-
voted, but Let whatsoever wine I shall taste be as sometkiwq
devoted.- that is, To me Zet all wine be devoted, ancl not to be
tasted.

Secondly, This form of speech *1³7 rum *mm ῙΞἾΠ Δῶρον,
ὃ ἐὰν ἐξ ἐμοῦ ὠφεληθῇς Α yv‘fl, by zvhatsoever thou oniylctest be pro-
fitecl by me, does neither argue, that he who thus spake de-
voted his goods to sacred uses, nor obliged him (according to
the doctrinei of the scribes) to devote them3 but only re-
strained him by an obligation from that thing, for the denying
of which he used such a form; that is, from helping him by
his goods, to whom he thus spake. He might help others
with his wealth, but him he might not.

Thirdly, The words are brought in as though they were
pronounced with indignation3 as if, when the needy father
required food from his son, he should answer in anger and
with contempt, Let it be as α tlcz'nq devoted, whatsoever of mine
may] profit thee. But now, things that were devoted were not
to be laid out upon common useS.

Fourthly, Christ not only cites the laW, ‘ Honour thy father
and mot-her,' but adds this also, “O κακολογῶν πατέρα ἢ μητέρα,
He that cursetlzfather or mother. But now there was no κακο-
λογία, συνείπῃ, here at all; if the son spoke truly and modestly,
and as the thing was, namely, that all his estate was devoted
before.

Fifthly, Therefore, although these words should have been
spoken by the son irreverently, wrathfully‚ and inhumanly,
towards his father, yet such was the folly, together with the

i Leusclen‘s edition, vol. 2. p. 333.
