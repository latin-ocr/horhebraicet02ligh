84 Hebrew and Tabmudz'cal [Oh. iv. ι.

The first scene or field of the combat was the ‘desert of
Judea,’ which Luke intimates, when he saith, that “Jesus
returned from Jordan, and that he was led by the Spirit into
the wilderness ;'’ that is, from the same coast or region of
Jordan in which he had been baptized.

The time of his temptations was from the middle of the
mouth Tisri to the end of forty days3 that is, from the begin-
ning of our month of October to the middle of November, or

thereabouts: so that he conflicted with cold, as well as want ³

and Satan.

The mamzer of his temptatione was twofold. Fi1·st,invi-
sibly, as the devil is wont to tempt sinners; and this for
sorty days: while the tempter endeavoured with all his in-
dustry to throw in his suggestions, if possible, into the mind
of Christ, as he does to mortal men. Which when he could

eye, and the pride of life:” which are the heads of all sins,
1 John ii. 16.

By ‘² the lust of the eyes :” for “ she saw the fruit, that it
was pleasant to the sight.”

By ‘⁶ the lust of the flesh ;” she lusted for it, because “it
was desirable to be eaten.”'

By “the pride of life;” not contented with the state of
perfection wherein she was created, she affected a higher;
and she “tookl of the fruit, and did eat‚” that she might
become wiser by it.

The same temptet· set upon our Saviour with the same
stratagems.

I. As Eve was deceived by mistaking his person, supposing
a good angel discoursed with her when it was a bad, so the
