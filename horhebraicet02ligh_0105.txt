“ Blessed, blessed,” thundereth out curses, “ Vv'oe, woe‚''
Luke vi. 24—26.

That which many do comment concerning the oc'tonary
number of beatitudes hath too much curiosity, and little
benefit. It hath that which is like it among the Jews: for
thus they write¹; ‘⁶ There is a tradition from the school of
R, Esaiah Ben Korcha, that twenty blessings are pronounced
in the Book of the Pmlms, and in like manner twenty woes
in the Book of Isaiah. ⁴ But I say‚' saith Rabbi, ‘ that there
are two-and-twenty blessings, according to the number of the
two-and-twenty letters.”

“ Abrahamm was blessed with seven blessings.”

“ Thesen six are blessed, every one with six blessings,
David, Daniel, and his three companions, and king Messias.”

Ver. 8⁰: Μακάριοι οἱ καθαροὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ· Blessed are the pure
in haara] Hearken, Ο Pharisee‚ all whose praise lies in
outward cleanness. How foolish is this boasting of a J ew!
⁶⁸ Comei* and see, saith R. Simeon Ben Eleazar, how far the
purity of Israel extends itself : when it is not only appointed,
that a clean man eat not with an unclean woman; but [that
an unclean man eat not with an unclean man] that a Pha-
risee that hath the gonorrhoea eat not with a common person
that hath the gonorrhoea.''

which bring forth good fruit in this life, and benefit in the
life to come.

Ver. 17: Μὴ νομίσητε ὅτι ἦλθον καταλῦσαι τὸν νόμον, &a
Think· not that I am come to destroy the law, &cd Ι. It was
the opinion of the nation concerning the Messias, that he
would bring in a new laW‚ but not at all to the prejudiee or
damage of Moses and the prophets: but that he would ad-
vance the Mosaic law to the very highest pit-ch, and would
fulfil those things that were foretold by the prophete, and
that according to the letter, even to the greatest pomp.
