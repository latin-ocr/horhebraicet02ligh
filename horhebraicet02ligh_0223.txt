not Herod of the Saddueean faith3 For that which is said by
Matthew, “ Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Saddu-
ceeS,'’ chap. xvi. 6, is rendered by Mar-k, ⁶⁸ Beware of the leaven
of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,'' chap. viii. 15 ς
that. is, ‘ of their doctrine)

If, therefore, Herod embraced the doctrine of the Saddu-
cces, his words, “ This is ‚John the Bam-ist, he is risen from
the dead,'’ seem to be extorted from his conscience, pricked
with the sting of horror and guilt, as though the image and
ghost of the Baptist, but newly butchered by him, were
before his eyes: so that his mind is under horror, and
forgetting his Sadduceism, groaning and trembling, he ac-
knowledgeth the resurrection of the dead, whether he will
or no.

Or let it be supposed, that with the Pharisees he owned
the resurrection of the dead3 yet certainly it was unusual for
them that confessed it to dream of the resurrection of one
that was but newly dead: they expected there should be a
resurrection of the dead hereafter: but this, which Herod
speaks, believes, and suspects, is a great way distant from
that doctrine, and seems, indeed, to have proceeded from a
conscience touched from above.
