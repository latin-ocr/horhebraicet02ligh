and 130 rise” (that is, the walls were built winding in and out,
or indented after the manner of xvaves), “being thus fitted
to receive the plaster, which he intended to lay on3 but the
Rabbins said to him, ‘ Ο let it continue, for it is very beau-
tiful to behold: for it is like the waves of the sea:' and
Bava Ben Buta made it so‚” Sec. See there the story of
Bava Ben Buta and Herod consulting about the rebuilding
of 1110 Temple.

Ver. 2: Οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον· There shall not be
left one stone upon another] The Talmudic Chroniclesy bear
witness also to this saying, “On the ninth day of the month
Ab the city of Jerusalem was ploughed up 3⁷³ which Maimo-
nidesZ delivereth more at large: ‘⁶ On that ninth day of tho
month Ab, fatal for vengeanee, the wicked Turnus Rufus, of
the children of Edem, ploughed up the Temple, and the
places about it, that that saying might be fulfilled, ‘Sion
shall be ploughed as a field? '' This Turnus Rufus, of great
fame and infamy among the J ewish writers, without doubt is
the same with Terentius Rufus, of whom J osephus speaks a,
Τερέντιος Ῥοῦφος ἅρχων τῆς στρατιᾶς κατελέλειπτο, Terentius
Rufus was Zcfft ,qenered of the army by Tam,- with commission, ’
as it is probable, and as the Jews suppose, to destroy the
city and Temple. Ooncerning which matter, thus again
J osephus in the place before quotedb, Κελεύει Καῖσαρ ἤδη τήν
τε πόλιν ἅπασαν καὶ τὸν νεὼν κατασκάπτειν T he emperor
commanded {laem to diff up the whole city ancl the Temple.
And a little after, Οὕτως ἐξωμάλισαν οἱ κατασκάπτοντες, See.
“ Thus those that diygyed it up laid all level, that it should
never be inhabited, to be a witness to such as should come
thither.”

Ver. 3 ε Καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον τῆς σῆς παρουσίας, καὶ τῆς συντελείας
τοῦ αἰῶνος; And what shall be the 31911 of thy eominfs, and of the
end of the world ?] What the apostles intended by these words
is more clearly eonceived by consider-ing the opinion of that
people concerning the times of the Messias, We will pick out
this in a few words from Babyloniam Sanlzedrinss
