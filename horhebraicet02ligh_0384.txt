378 Hebrew and Talmudioal [Ch. xxviii. ¹9·

Ἐκράτησαυ αὐτοῦ τοὺς πόδας· They held kim by the feet]
This seems to have been done to kiss his feet. So 2 Kings iv.
27. For this was not unusual: “As R. J anni and R. J onathan
were sitting together, a certain man came and kissed the
feet of R. J onatha11d.” Compare the evangeliste here, and
you will find that this was done by Mary Magdalene only,
who formerly had kissed Christ's feet, and who had gone
twice to the sepulchre, however Matthew makes mention but
of once going. The story, in short, is thus to be laid toge-
ther: At. the first dawning of the morning Christ arose, a
great earthquake happening at that time. About the same
time Magdalene and the other women left their houses to go
to the sepulchre: while they met together and made all
things ready, and took their journey to the tomb, the sun
was up. When they were come, they are informed of his re-
surrection by the angels, and sent back to the disciples. The
matter being told to the disciples, Peter ancl John run to the
sepulchre; Magdalene also followed after them. They having
seen the signs of the resurrection return to their company,
but she stays there. Being ready to return back, Christ ap-
pears to her, she supposiny kim to be the §ardenen As soon as she
knew him, she worships him3 and embracing his feet, kisseth
them. And this is the history before uS, which Matthew re-
lates in the plural number, running it over briefly and com—
pendiously, according to his manner.

whereby the apostles were kept in from preaching the gospel
to all the Gentiles, Matt. x. 5. For, first, the ‚Jews had now
lost their privilege, nor were they henceforward to be counted
a peculiar people3 nay, they were now become “Lo-ammi.''
They had exceeded the heathens in sinning, they had slighted,
trampled upon, aud crucified the Creator himself, appearing
visibly before their eyes in human flesh3 while the heathens
had only conceived amiss of the Creator, whom they neither
