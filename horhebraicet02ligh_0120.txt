only and bare restitution, which might be done without a
charitable mind and a brotherly heart. But Christ urgeth
charity, reconciliation of mind, and a pure desire of reunion
with our offended brother: and that not only in money mat-
ters, but in any other, and for whatever cause, wherein our
neighbour complains that he is grie-ved.

Ver. 24 z ’Άφες ἐκεῖ τὸ δῶρόν σου ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου·
Leavek there thy φξβ before the altar] This business was alto-
gether unusual in gifts offered at the altar, in such a cause.
We read, indeed, of the drink-offering, delayed after the
sacrifice was offered: “ F orl the wise men say, That a man
is not held in his sin, when the driuk—offering is put off by
some delay; because one may offer his sacrifice to-day, but
his drink-offering twenty days hence.” We read also that
the oblation of a sacrifice presented even at the altar, in some
cases hath not only been delayed, but the sacrifice itself hath
been rejected ς that is, if, in that instant, discovery was made,
in sacrificing the beast, either of a blemish, or of somewhat
else, whereby it became an illegal sacrifice3 or if some un-
cleanness or other cause appeared in the offerer, whereby he
was rendered unfit for the present to offer a gift. Of which
things, causing the oblation of the sacrifice already presented
at the altar to be deferred, the Hebrew lawyers speak much.
But among those things we do not meet at all with this
whereof our Saviour is here speaking: so that he seems to
enjoin some new matter‚—-and not new alone, but seemingly
impossible. For the offended brother might perhaps be
absent in the furthcst parts of the land of Israel, so that he
could not be spoke with, and his pardon asked in very many
days after: and what shall become of the beast in the mean
time, which is left at the alt-ar? It is a wonder indeed that
our Saviour, treating of the worship at the altar, should pre-
scribe such a duty, which was both unusual (in such a case)
and next to impossible. But it is answered :—

I. It was a custom and a law among the Jews, that the
sacrifices of particular men should not presently, as soon as
they were due, be brought to the altar, but that they should
bc reserved to the feast next following, whatsoever that were,
whether the Passover, or Pentecost, or 'sabernacles, to be
