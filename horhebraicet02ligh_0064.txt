lamb in the Passover was of divine institution, and so indeed
was the bread. But whence was the wine? But yet, rejecting

the lamb, Christ instituted the sacrament in the bread and
w1ne.

Seoonfflyh, Observing from these things which have been ”

spoken, how very known and frequent the use of baptism was
among the Jews, the reason appears very easy why the San-
hedrim, by their messengers, inquii-ed not of John concerning
the reason of baptism, but concerning the authority os the
baptizer, not what baptism meant, but whence he had a
license so to baptize, John i. 2 5.

Thirdly, Hence also the reason appears why the New Tes-
tament doth not prescribe, by some more accurate rule, who
the persons are to be baptized. The Anabaptists object, ‘ It
is not commanded to baptize infants,—-theref'ore they are not

common use, prevailed. If a royal proclamation should now
issue forth in these words, “Let every one resort, on the
Lord's day, to the public assembly in the church ;'' certainly
he would be mad, who, in times to come, should argue hence
that prayers, sermons, singing of psalms, were not to be cele-
brated on the Lord“s day in the public assemblies, because
there is no mention of them in the proclamation. For the
proclamation provided for the celebration of the Lord's day
in the public assemblies in general : but there was no need to
make mention of the particular kinds of the divine worship
