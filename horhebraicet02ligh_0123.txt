That which is here said by 1116 Jerusalem Talmud, *lm
ὩὯΞἾἾἺἾΡ ΠὫΟἾἻΞ Two prntalcs make a fiz-rtlcings, is the very
same thing that is said, Mark xii. 42, Λεπτὰ δύο, ὅ ἐστι κο.
δράυτης, Two mites, which make a fartlcinq. A prutalc was the
very 16351 piece among coins. So Maimonides a, ΠἾΠΞ ΓΝ
prm rma-me ΠἯΒὩ lect which is not worth α pratella, is '³ not
to be reckoned czmony nielles. Hence are 111056 11111111)61·1655
passages in 1116 Talmudic Pandects relating 10 the prutah:
“ HeC 11131 516315 1655 than a prutalc is not bound 10 pay
five-fold.'' “ Nod land is bought for a price less 111311 3

You have 1116 value of these coins in 1116 same Maimoni-
des: ‘⁶ Selaa (saith hee) is in value four-peuce: a penny, six
11163115. Now a meah, in 1116 days of Moses our master, was
called 3 gerah3 11 contains two pondions ,ε 3 pondion‚ two
assars3 and a prutah is the eighth part of 311 35531.. The
weight of a meah, which is also called a gemb, is sixteen
barleycorns. And 1116 weight of an assat· is four bai-ley-
corns. And the weight of a prutah is halfa barleyeor11.”

but 1116 fourth part of 311 assam· which how very small a part
of 3 penny 11 was, we may observe by those things 11131 are
said by both Gemaras in t-he place before cited.
