shall not orow once, or the cock shall not crow at all. But it is
not s0; but it amounts to this sense, “ Within the time of
cockcrowing'' thou shalt deny me thrice3 for Peter had de-
nied him but once before the first crowing of the cock, and
thrice before the second, Mark xiv. 68, 72. From hence,
therefore, we may easily observe in what sense those words
are to be understood, which were spoken to Peter two days
before the Passover‚ John xiii. 38, “ The cock shall not crow‚”
&c: not that the cock should not crow at all between thatb
time and Peter's denying3 but as if our Saviour had said,
“Are you so secure os yourself, Ο Peter? Verily, Ι say unto
you, the time shall be, and that shortly, when you shall deny
me thrice within the time of cockcrowing.” Ἐν ἀλεκτορο-

it is said, “ This oziylzt, before the cock cr0w‚” &c. Matt.
xxvi. 34; Mark xiv. 303 Luke xxii. 34. But there is nothing
of this said in that supper, John xiii.

that doth not crow too soon nor too late.'' The Misna on
which this Gloss is hath these words; “Every day they
remove the ashes from the altar about cockcrowing; but on
the day of atonement at midnight,” &c.

You may wonder that a dunghill cock should be found at
Jerusalem, when it is forbid by the canons that any eoeks
should be kept there: 'JDD tabum-m ζ’·ἶῖἺλὶἾΠ ΓΒἾἎὮ ΓΝ
ὩἾΨΤᾯ “ Theyd do not keep cocks at Jerusalem, upon account of
the holy illimis,- nor do the priests keep them throughout all
the land of Israel.'' The Gloss gives the reason; “ Even
Israelites are forbid to keep cocks at Jerusalem, because of
the holy things: for Israelites have eaten there peace offer-
ings and thank offerings: but now it is the custom of dung-
