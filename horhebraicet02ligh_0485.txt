Oh. xvi. 15] Exercitations upon St. Mark. 4079

thew is, μαθητεύσατε πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, disc‘e‘ple all nat‹ions‚· as
those words also of St. Paul, Oolos. i. 23, εὐαγγελίου τοῦ κη-
ρυχθέντος ἐν πάσῃ τῇ κτίσει, tlte yospel that was preat-laed 2⁶72 all
the creatiou.

ln the same sense you must, of necessity, understand the
same phrase, Rom. viii. 22. Where, if you take the whole
passage concerning the Gentiles breathing after the evange-
lical liberty of the sons of God, you render the sense very
easy, and very agreeable to the mind of the apostle‚ and to
the signification of the word κτίσις, creature, or creatiooz .· when
they who render it otherwise dash upon I know not what
rough and knotty sense. Let me, although it is out of my
road, thus paraphrase the whole place :—-

Rom.viii. 19: ‘H γὰρ ἀποκαραδοκία τῆς κτίσεως, &c. “ ‘ For tlte
earnest expectation of the creature, or of the heathen world,
waiteth for the revelation of the sons of Grod.q For Grod had
promised, and had very often pronounced by his prophets,
that he would gather together, and adopt to himself, innu-
merable sons among the Gentiles. Therefore, the whole
Gentile world dot-h now greedily expect the revelation and
production of those sons.''

Ver. 20: Τῇ γὰρ ματαιότητι ἡ κτίσις ὑπετάγη, 8ῦο. “ For the
creature, the whole heathen world, was subjeeted to the vanity
of their mind (as Rom. i. 21, ἐματαιώθησαυ ἐν τοῖς διαλογισμοῖς
αὐτῶν, became vain in their imayiozations; and Eph. iv‚ 1 7, ἔθνη
περιπατεῖ {uh ματαιότητι τοῦ νοὸς αὐτῶν, the Gentiles walk in the
vanity of their mind), not willingly, but because of him that
subjected it.''

Ver. 21 2 “ Under hope, because the creature also'' (or that
hoamen world) “shall be freed from the service of” (sinful)
“ corruption” (which is in the world through lust, 2 Pet. i. 4),
“into the (gospel) liberty of the sons of God :'' from the ser-
vice of Satan, of idols, and of lusts, into the liberty which the
sons of God enjoy through the gospel.

Ver. 22: Οἴδαμεν γὰρ, ὅτι πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις, 850. “For we
know, that the whole creature'' (or heathen world) “ groaneth
together, and travaileth, and, as it were, with a convex weight‚
