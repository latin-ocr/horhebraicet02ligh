before us doth more clearly appear. Doth it deserve so
severe a curse, to adorn the sepulchres of the prophete and
righteous men? Was not this rather an act of piety than a
crime? But according to their own doctrine, O ye scribes and
Pharisees‚ ζΞἾἾΞῖ ln ἶΠἾἾΞἻ their own acts and sayings are
a sufficient memorial for them. thy do ye not respect,
follow, and imitate these? But neglecting and trampling
upon these, you persuade yourselves that you have performed
piety enough to them, if you bestow some eost in adorning
their sepulchres, whose words indeed you despise.

Ver. 34: Σοφοὺς καὶ γραμματεῖς· Wise men aad scribes]
ΠὍΞΠ wisc men, and ΞἿἾΞἾΟ scribes. Let them observo
this, who do not allow the ministers of the word to have a
distinct calling. The Jews knew not any that was called
ΕΞΠ α wisa man, or amc> a scribe, but who was both learned,
and separated from the common people by a distinct order
and office.

Ver. 35: ‘'Ems τοῦ αἵματος Ζαχαρίου υἱοῦ Βαραχίου· Unio
the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias] That the discourse
here is concerning Zacharias the son of Jehoiada ὓ, killed by
king J oash, we make appear by these arguments :

I. Because no other Zacharias is said to have been slain
before these words were spoken by Christ. Those things
that are spoke of Zacharias, the father of the Baptist, are
dreams ; and those of Zacharias, one of the twelve prophets,
are not much better. The killing of our Zacharias in the
Temple is related in express words: and why, neglecting
this, should we seek for another, which in truth we shall
nowhere find in any author of good credit ‘3

II. The Jews observe, that the death of this Zacharias,
the son of J ehoiada, was made memorable by a signal cha-
racter [nota] and revenge: of the martyrdom of the other
Zacharias they say nothing at all.
