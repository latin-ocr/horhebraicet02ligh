Oh. vi. 1.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 135

Publicanse are f joined with cut-throats and robbers.
pomp& ΓὮἾΠῘὮἹ Phi-1¹7 ΓἾἿἸ] “ They swear to cat-throats‚
to robbers and to publicans [invadiny their qoods], This is an
offering, &c. He is known by his companion.''

They were marked with such reproach, and that not with-
out good reason; partly by reason of their rapine, partly,
that to the burden laid upon the nation they themselves
added another burden.

“ Wheng are publicans to be reckoned for thieves? when
he is a Gentile3 or when of himself he takes that office upon
him; or when, being deputed by the king, he doth not exact
the set sum, but exacts according to his own will.'’ Therefore
the father of R. Zeira is to be reputed for a rare personh, who,
being a publican for thirteen years, did not make the burdens
of the taxes heavier, but rather eased them.

“ Wheni the king laid a taxk, to be exacted of the Jews,
of each according to his estate, these publicans, being de-
puted to proportion the thing, became respecters of persons,
burdening some and indulging others, and so became plun-
derers.”

By how much the more grievous the heathen yoke was to
the J ewish people, boasting themselves a free nation‚ so much
the more hateful to them was this kind of men ; who, though
sprung of J ewish blood, yet rendered their yoke much more
heavy by these rapines.
