(for ye expect refreshment and consolation under the Mes-
sias); and he may send J esus Christ first preached to you.”
And ver. 26, “ To you first G0d‚ raising up his Son, sent him
to bless y0u,'’ &a The epoch of the Messias is dated from
the resurrection of Christ.

Ver. 25: Βεελζεβούλ· Beelzebub] See chap. xii. 24.

Ver. 27: ⁶0 εἰς τὸ οὓς ἀκούετε· What ye hear in the east]
We have observed before, that allusion is here made to the
manner of the schools, where the doctor whispered, out of
the chair, into the ear of the interpreter, and he with a loud
voice repeated to the whole school that which was spoken in
the ear. .

“ Theyf said to Judah Bar Nachmani, ΨἾἾἾ rium-urm
127⁸?ss tlte interpreter of Resh Lachish, ΝἾἾὩΝΞ ΓΓᾸᾋ) ΕἹΡ
Do you stand sbr his expositor.'' The Gloss is, ‘⁵ To tell out
the exposition to the synagogue, *15 '‘U'll'llv'w rm which ke
shall wlcisper to you.” We cannot here but repeat that which
we produced before, ,ΠἾἾἎὩ ἶἾΨῖὩ *2³7 ΨΠἸίὩ ΞΒΠΠ The doctor
wlzispered him in the car in Hebrew. And we cannot but
suspect that that custom in the church of Corinth which the
apostle reproves, of speaking in the synagogue in an unknown
tongue‚ were some footsteps of this custom.

We read of whispering in the ear done in another sense,
namely‚ to a certain woman with child, which longed for
the perfumed flesh ; ‘² Thereforeg Rabbi said, ΠΒ &ww-1³7 '53753
Go whisper ker that it is the day of Expiation. nl? *tzmr'llv
ΝΦἾΠῙὈἾΝἸ They whispered to ker, ancl she was wkispered :'' that
is, she was satisfied and at quiet.

Κηρύξατε ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων· Preach ye upon the housetops]
Perhaps allusion is made ’to that custom whenh the minister
of the synagogue on the sabbath-eve sounded with a trumpet
six times upon the roof of an exceeding high house, that
thence all might have notice of the coming in of the sabbath.
The first sound was, that they should cease from their works
in the fields 3 the second, that they should cease from theirs
in the city; the third, that they should light the sabbath
candle‚ &c.
