Ch. xxvi. 6.] Evercfitations upon Sl. Matthew. 339

this time forward there is no account either of his supping or
going to Jerusalem till the evening of the Passover.

From that supper both the evangelists begin their story
of Judas's contriving to betray our Lord3 Matt. xxvi. 143
Mark xiv, 10: and very fitly; for at that supper the devil
had entered into him, and hurried him forward to accom-
plish his villany.

We therefore thus draw up the series of the history out
of the holy writers: Before the fhcrst of the Passover (John
xiii. 1), namely, two days (Matt. xxvi. 2, 6), as -Jesus was
supping in Bethany, a woman anoints his head ε and some of
the disciples murmur at it. Our Saviour himself becomes
both her advocate and encomiast. Before supper was done
Christ riseth from the table, and washeth his disciples' feet;
and, sitting down again, acquaints them with the betrayer.
John asking privately about him, he privately also gives him
a token by a sop, and gives a sop to J udas, With this the
devil entered into him, and now he grows ripe for his wicked-
ness: “The devil had before put it into his heart to betray
him,” ver. 23 now he is impatient till he hath done it. He
riseth up immediately after he had the sop, and goes out.
As he was going out, J esus said to him, ‘⁶ What thou doest,
do quickly :³⁵ which some understood of buying necessaries for
the feast, that was now two days off. It was natural and
easy for them to suppose, that he, out of his diligence (having
the purse, and the care of providing things that were neces-
sary), was now gone to Jerusalem, though it were night, there
being a great deal to be done, to get all things ready against
the feast. He goes away; comes to Jerusalem 3 and the
next day treats with the priests about betraying our Lord,
and concludes a bargain with them. They were afraid for
themselves, lest they should be either hindered by the people‚
or suffer some violence from them on the feast day. He frees
them from this sear, provided they would let him have soldiers
and company ready at the time appointed. Our Saviour
lodges at Bethany that night, and spends the next day and
the night after there too: and, being now ready to takc his
leave of his disciples, he tcaches, instructs, and comforts them
at large. J udas, having craftily laid the design of his
treachery, and set his nets in readiness, returns as is pro-
