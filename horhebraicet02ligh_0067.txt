Oh. iii. 6.] Exercitations upon Sc. Matthew. 61

forbids not a menstruous woman, and other unclean persons,
to wash in streams, where they might : but it permits, where
they might not, to wash in some confluence of waters ; which
was not lawful for a man that had the gonorrhoea to do. The ’
same is to be understood concerning the baptism of a prose-
lyte, who was allowed to wash himself in streams: and was
allowed also, where there were no streams, to wash in a con-
fluence of waters.

IV. W henS a proselyte was to be circumcised, they first
asked him concerning the sincerity of his conversion to Ju-
daism: whether he offered not himself to proselytism for the
obtaining riches, for sear, or for love to some Israelite woman,
&a And when they saw that he came out of love of the law,
they instructed him concerning the various articles of the law,
of one God, of the evil of idolatry, of the reward of obedience‚ .
of the world to come, of the privileges of Israel, &a All
which, if he professed that he embraced them he is forthwith
circumcised.

“ Ast soon as he grows whole of the wound of circum-
cision, they bring him to baptism; and being placed in the
water, they again instruct him in some weightier and in
some lighter commands of the law. Which being heard,

wan-r ³7:2³7 &saum mn *w mbr-s ³7:10 ke plunges him-
sels, and comes up, and behold, he is as cm I sraelite in aa thiozqs.
The women place a woman in the waters up to the neck;
and two disciples of the wise men, standing without, instruct
her about some lighter precepts of the law and some weightier‚
while she, in the meantime, stands in the waters. ἿΞ ἾΠΝἹ

In the baptizing of a proselyte, this is not to be passed

over, but let it be observed, namely, that im& Γίθῗῑῑῡῗο
others baptized him, and that ³7:510 &Tru he baptized him-

what that plunging waS‚ you may understand from those
things which Maimonides speaks in Mikvaoth in the place
