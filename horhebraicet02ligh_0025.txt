Oh. i. ¹23] Eoeezr‘cfitatrious [alfnon st. Matthmv. 19

Λάθρα ἀπολύσαι αὐτήν· Pm laer away pririlffi] Let the
Talmudic tract ‘ Gittin’ be looked upon, where they are
treating of the manner of delivering a bill of divorce to a
wife to be put away ε among other things, it might be given
privately, if the husband so pleased, either into the woman's
hand or bosom, two witnesses only present.

Ver. 23: Ἰδοὺ, ἡ παρθένος ἐι) γαστρὶ ἕξει· Balaam, a virqin
shall be with child] That the word Πᾩίᾓέἶ, in the prophet,
denotes an uutouclzed vv‘qyioz, sufficient-ly* appears from the
sense of the place, Isa. vii. 14. King Ahaz there was afraid,
lest the enemies that were now upon him might dest-roy J eru-
salem, and utterly consume the house of Davidss. The Lord
meets this sear by a signal and most remarkable promise,
namely, ‘ that sooner should a pure virgin bring forth a child,
than the family of David perish.' And the premise yields a
double comfort: namely‚ of Christ hereafter to be born of a
viryin; and of their security from the imminent danger ol
the city and house of David. So that, although that pro-
phecy, of a viryz'n's bringing forth a son, should not be ful-
filled till many hundreds of years after, yet, at that present
time, when the prophecy was made, Ahaz had a certain and
notable sign, that the house of David should be safe and
secure from the danger that hung over it. As much as if
the prophet had said, ‘⁶ Be not so troubled, O Ahaz3 does it
not seem an impossible thing to thee, and that never will
happen, that a pure viryin should become a mother? But I
tell thee, a pure viryiw shall bring forth a son, before the
house of David perish.”

Hear this, O unbelieving Jew! and shew us now some
remainders of the house of David : or confess this prophecy
sulfilled in the Viryin’s bringing forth: or deny that a sign
was given, when a sign is given.

tongue to the Jewish nation dwelling in J udea τ, and that the
Hebrew was not at all understood by the common people
