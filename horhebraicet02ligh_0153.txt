one‚'' &a That Rabban Gamaliel, which is here spoke of,
was Paul's master. For, although Rabban Gamalie] (who
was commonly styled ‘ Jafnensis‚' of Jaftm) was the nephew
of Paul's master, Gamahel, and this thing is mentioned to be
done in Jafne; yet Paul’s master also lived in Jafne: and
that this was he of whom is the story before us, sufficiently
appears hence, because his business is with Samuel the Little‚
who certainly died before the destruction of the city.

Under Gamaliel the elder, therefore, were those daily
prayers reduced first into that order wherein they were re-
ceived by the following ages. Which, however it was done
after the death of our Saviour, in regard of their reducing
into order, yet so many there were in daily use at that time
when he conversed on earth. Now he condemned not those
prayers altogether, nor esteemed them of no account3 yea.
on the contrary, he joined himself to the public liturgy in
the synagogues, and in the Temple: and when he deliver-
eth this form to his disciples, he extinguisheth not other
forms.

ΙΙ. When all could not readily repeat by heart those
numerous prayers‚ they were reduced into a brief summary,
in which the marrow of them all was eomprised3 and that
provision was made for the memory‚ that they should have
a short epitome of those prayers, whom the weakness of their
memory, or sometime the unavoidable necessity of business,
permitted not to repeat a longer prayer, or to be at leisure
to do it. This summary they called ΓῘΩὩ α fountain. “Rab-
ban Gamaliel saith, ‘ Let every one pray the eighteen prayers
every day.' R. Joshua saith, ’ΠἾ ΓὩῺ ΕΒΞΠἾ, Lot kim prag)
γ the ppt), the summam of those eiylzteen. But R. Akibah saith,

''r-r rm &ab nsi “ru &henin rm urbm-1 muza ns
prrayer be free in leis mouth, let him prag] the er'ykteen ,· but ‘cf
not, let him φνας] the summary of those eiylzteen¹¹.'' That our
Saviour comprised the sum of all prayers in this form, is
known to all Christia11s3 and it is confessed that such is the
perfection of this form, that it is the epitome of all things to
be prayed for, as the Decalogue is the epitome of all things
to be practised.
