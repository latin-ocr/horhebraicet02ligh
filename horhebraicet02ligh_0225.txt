Josephus relates that {John was imprisoned by Herod in
Machaerus: ι’1’“”1ῑοκ1]ίᾳ τῇ Ἡρώδου δέσμιος εἷς τὸυ Μαχαιροῦντα
πεμφθείς· ΤΙινοῑιῃΙιΥ tlte suspicion qf Herod ke zoas sent prisoner
to Mac-laceras. Now Machaerus was the utmost bounds of
Pereazz and Perea was within Herod‘s jurisdictiona. But
now if John lay prisoner there, when the decree went out
against his life, the executioner must have gone a long jour-
ney, and which could scarcely be performed in two days from
Tiberias, where the tyrant's court was, to execute that bloody
command. So that that hol-rid dish, the head of the vene-

rable prophet, could not be presented to the maid but some
days after the celebration of his birthday.

The time of his beheading we find out by those words of
the evangelist John b, “ but now the Passover was nigh,” by
reasoning after this manner: It may be concluded, without
all controversy, that the discipleS, as soon as they heard of
the death of their master, and buried him, betook them-
selves to Christ, relating his slaughter, and giving him cau-
tion by that example to take care of his own safety. He
hearing of it passeth over into the desert of Bethsaida, and
there he miraculously feeds five thousand men, when the
Passover was now at hand, as John relates, mentioning that
story with the rest of the evangelists. Therefore we suppose
the beheasling of the Baptist was a little before the Passoven
when he had now been in durance half a year, as he had
freely preached by the space of half a year before his impri-
sonment.

is, from CapernaumC into the desert of Bethsaida, which is
rendered by Johnd, Ἀπῆλθεν πέραν τῆς θαλάσσης, He went
over the sea. Which is to be understood properly, namely‚
from Galilee into Perea. The chorographical maps have
placed Bethsaida in Galilee, on the same coast on which
Capernaum is also : so also commentatore feign to themselves
a bay of the sea only coming between these two cities, which
