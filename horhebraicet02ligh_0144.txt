138 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. vi. 2.

Εἰ δὲ μήγε, μισθὸν οὐκ ἔχετε· Otherwise ,γε have no reward]
He therefore seems the rather to speak of a reward, because
they expected a reward for their alms·doing without all doubt ;
and that, as we said, for the mere work done.

‘⁴ R. Lazar x was the almoner of the synagogue. One
day going into his house, he said, ‘What news ζ’ They an-
swered‚ ⁶ Some came hither, and ate and drank, and made
prayers for thee.’ ‘Then,' saith he, ‘ there is no good reward?
Another time going into his house, he said, ‘What news3'
It was answered, ‘ Some others came, and ate and drank, and
railed upon you.' ‘Nowss saith he, ‘ there will be a good
reward.' '⁵

Ver. 2: Μὴ σαλπίσῃς ἔμπροσθέν σου, ὥσπερ οἱ ὑποκριταὶ
ποιοῦσιν ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς, καὶ ἐν ταῖς ῥύμαις· Do not sound α
trumpet before thee, as the hypocritas do in the synayoyues, and
in the πνρας] It is a just scruple‚ whether this sounding a
trumpet be to be understood according to the letter, or in a
borrowed sense. I have not found, although I have sought
for it much and seriously‚ even the least mention of a trumpet
in almsgiving. Ι would most willingly be taught this from
the more learned.

Yon may divide the ordinary alms of the Jews into three
parts:

I. ἾἹΠῺΠ the ahastdish. They gave alms to the pub-
lic dish or basket: ἾἹΠὩΠ Tamchuz‘ (according to the defi-
nition of the author of Aruch, and that out of Bava Bathra
in the place lately cited) was a certain vesseL in which bread

and food was gathered :Lym ”2le for the poor of the world.
You may not improperly call it tlte alms'—basket,· he calls it

ΠἾὨΡ α dish. By the poor qf the world are to be under-
stood any beqyars, begging from door to door; yea, even
heathen beggars. Hence the Jerusalem Talmud in the place

above quoted, 1:51& 3725 ΨἹΠὩΠ The alms'- dish was for every
mom. And the Aruch moreover‚ ΠΕ, ΕἸἿ ³722 ΠἿΞΖῚΠ
' :12 nplvrvnnw This alms was yatlzered daily by three meu,
and distributae& by three. It was gathered of the townsmen by
collectors within their doors; which appears by that cautiony3
