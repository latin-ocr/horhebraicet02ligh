II. As to those that were to be hanged, ,ΠΝ ἾΠἸΝ primm
ἸΞἾἾ ἾΌἎ they delayed the finishiny his judyment, and they
hanged him not in the morning, lest they might grow slack
about his burial, and might fall into forgetfulness,'’ and might
sin against· the law, Deut. xxi. 233 “but near sunset, that
they might presently bury himss’ So the Gloss. They put
him to death not sooner, for this reason; they finished not his
judgment sooner for the reason above said.

And now let us resume the words of Mark, “ And it was
the third hour, and they crucified him.” The Sanhedrim used
not to finish the judgment of hanging until they were now
ready to rise up and depart from the council and bench aster
the Mincha‚ the day now inclining towards sunset : but. these
men finished the judgment of -J esus, and hastened him to the
cross, when they first came into the court at the third honr,
at the time of the daily sacrifice, which was very unusual, and
different from the custom.

going before the sabbath was called parasceue, the preparation.
Among the Hebrews‚ indeed, it is commonly said ΠΞΨΠ :ny
the eve of the sabbath. But be it granted 3 whence is it called
the preparation? Either that they prepared themselves for the
sabbath3 or rather, that they prepared provisions to be eaten
on the sabbath; and that by the law, “ On the sixth day they
shall prepare, &c. Whatsoever ye will bake, bake to-day;
and whatsoever ye will seethe, seethe to-day,’' διο. Exod.
