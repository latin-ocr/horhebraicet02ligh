Hear Baal Turims: “ The Israelites were redeemed (saith
he) out of Egypt, because they observed circumcision and
the sabbath-day.” Yea, and further backward still: “ The
inheritancet of Jacob is promised to those that sanctify the
sabbath, because he sanctified the sabbath himself.” Yea,
and more backwards yet, even to the beginning of the world:
“Theu first psalm in the world was, when Adam's sin was
forgiven: and when the sabbath entered, he opened his
mouth and uttered the psalm of the sabbath.'’ So also the
Targum upon the title of Psalm xcii: “ The psalm or song
which Adam composed concerning the sabbath-days* Upon

the sabbath: the sabbath entered when he had now sinned,
and was his advocate with God,’' &a

“ Adamx was created on the sabbath-eve, that he might
immediately be put under the command.’'

of the Son of mem, that is, of the promised seed, to be or-
dered and disposed by him as he thought good, and as he
should make provision, for his own honour and the benefit
of man.

Ver. 10: Εἰ ἔξεστι τοῖς σάββασι θεραπεύειν; Is it lauficl to
