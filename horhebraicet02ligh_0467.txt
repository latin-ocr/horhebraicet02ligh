not toyether] The traditional canons, in these things, divide
testimonies into three parts 1-—

I. There was :7³7³722 ΠἹἾΏ a vain testimony: which being
heard, there is no more inquirye made from that witness, there

is no more use made of him, but he is set aeide, as speaking
nothing to the business.

ΙΙ. There was nnn? J’WIy a standing) testimony, for let
me so turn it here, which, although it proved not the matter
without doubt, yet it was not rejected by the judgeS, but ad-
mitted to examination by ΠὮῚΠ citation, that is, others being
admitted to try to disprove it if they could.

III. There was the testimony :mrum &nnn-rw: of the
words of them that ayreed or fitted toyetlcer (this also was
NDWs) ΠἸἻῺ a standiny evidence), when the words of two
witnesses agreed, and were to the same purpose: μαρτυρία
ἴση, an even evidence. Of these, see the tract Sanhedrinf ‚-
where also discourse is had concerning exact search and exa-
mination of the witnesses by ΠᾪἾἺΞ and ΠἿἾᾪΠ and ΠὮῚΠ
inquisition, and scratiny, and citation: by which curicus dis-
quisition if they had examined the witnesses that babbled and
barked against Christ, Oh! the unspeakable and infinite in-
nocence of the most blessed Jesus, which envy and madness
itself, never so much sworn together against his life, could
not have fastened any crime upon !

It is said, ver. 55, Ἐζήτουν κατὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ μαρτυρίαν· they
souylit for witness against Jesas. This is neither equal, O
fathers of the Sanhedrim! nor agreeable to your rule: ὌἿἾ

hedrim now followed that canon in their scrutiny about
Christ's case, let them look to it: by their whole process it
sufficiently appears„ whither their disquisition tended. And
let it be granted, that they pretended some colour of justice
and mercy, and permitted that any one who would, might
