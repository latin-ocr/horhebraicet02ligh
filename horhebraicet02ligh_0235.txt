impiety, of the traditional doctrine in this case, which pro-
nounced the son so obliged by these his words, that it was
lawful by no means to suecour his needy father. He was not
at all bound by these words to dedicate his estate to sacred
uses 3 but not to help his father he was inviolably bound. Ο
excellent doctrine and charity Ι

Sixthly, The words of the verse, therefore, may thus be
rendered, without any addition put between, which many in-
terpreters do: chosoever shall say to his father ον mother, Let
it be a [devoted] yift, in wlzatsoever thou magseszf be helped by me .-
then let him not honour his fitther aad mother at all.

Ver. 11 : Κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον· Defileth the mam] Or, mahath
him commoom so the word ‘7³05 seems to 'oe rendered in the
Pharisaic idiotism, as I may so speak3 because they esteemed
deffiled men for common and vulyar men: on the contrary, a
religious man among them is ἾἾΠἻ (ι ,ςῖηῃῑιίαν man. In Acts
x. ¹4¹¹, κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον, common or medeam, seem to speak
’ the same thing with &mm ἹΝ ἶῒῆῠῦ among the Talmudists.

Ver. 20: Ἀνίπτοις χερσί· With mzwashen hands] He saith
not with unclean hands, but amoccshem because, as we said
before, they were bound to wash, although they were not con-
scious that their hands were unclean. ln Mark it is κοιναῖς
χερσὶ, with common 01· defiled hands, Mark vii. 2 3 which seem
to be called by the Talmudists impure hands, merely because
not washed. Judge from that which is said in the tract
Challah: ‘⁶ A¹ cake is owing out of that dough which they
knead with the juice of fruits: mmmmm :³³72 1552}th
and it is caten with aracleam hands.''

Ver. 22: Γυνὴ Χαναναία· Α woman of Canama] In Mark it
is, Ἑλληνὶς, Συροφοίνισσα τῷ γένει, Α Greek woman, a Syrophoe-
nician by natio-n, chap. vii. 26.

Holy Biffle, reckoning up mm& “²5 the seven mentions, which
were to be destroyed by the Israelites, names the Perizzites‚
who were not at all recited among the sons of Oanaan, Gen. x.‚
and the Ganaanites as a particular nation, when all the seven,

indeed, were Canaanites. See Deut. vii. 1, Josh. ix. ι, xi. 3,
