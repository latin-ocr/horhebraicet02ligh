epoch of the kingdom of God took its beginning, as we said
before (which he himself also signifieth in those words Matt.
xxvi. 29); and when he arose, not a few others arose with
him. What they thought of the resurrection that was to be
in the days of Messias, besides those things which we have
already mentioned, you may see and smile at in this one ex-
ample: “ R. JeremiahS commanded, ‘When you bury me,
put shoes on my feet, and give me a staff in my hand, and
lay me on one side ; that when the Messias comes I may be
ready.⁷’'

Ver. 54: Ἀληθῶς Θεοῦ υἱὸς ἢν οὗτός· Truly this was the
›S‘on qf God] That is, “ This was indeed the Messias.”
Howsoever the Jews deny the Son of God in that sense in
which we own it, that is, as the second Person in the Holy
Trinity, yet they acknowledge the Messias for the Son of
God (not indeed by nature, but by adoption and deputation;
see Matt. xvvi. 63), from those places, 1 Chron. xvii. 13³
Psalm¹ ii. 123 lxxxix, 26, 27, and such-like. The centu-
rion had learned this from the people by conversing among
them, and, seeing the miracles which accompanied the death
of Christ, acknowledged him to be the Messias of whom he
had heard so many and great things spoken by the Jews. In
Lukeu we have these words spoken by him, “ Certainly this
was a righteous man :'' which, Ι suppose, were not the same
with these words before us; but that both they and these
were spoken by him, “ Certainly this was a righteous man:
truly this was the Messias, the Son of God.” Such are
the words of Nathanael, John i. 49, ‘⁶ Thou art the Son of
God ; thou art the King of Israel.” Peter, when he declared
that “ Christ was the Son of the living God,'' Matt. xvi. 16,
spoke this in a more sublime sense than the Jews either
owned or knew; as we have said at that place.

Ver. 56: Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνή· Μανμ Μαῃάαῖθηε.] That
Magdalene was the same with Mary the sister of Lazarus
Baroniusx proves at large3 whom see. It is confirmed enough
from this very place; for if Mary Magdalene was not the
same with Mary the sister of Lazarus, then either Mai-y
