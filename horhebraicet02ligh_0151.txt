Ver. 7: Μὴ βαττολογήσητε, ὥσπερ οἱ {omoi- Περ not vain repe-
titions, as the lzeathen cla] See the civil battolopgy [vain repetitions]
of the heathen 1n their supplications: “Letg the parricide be
dragg ced. we beseech t-,hee Augustus, let the parricide be
dragged. This is the thing we ask, let the parlicide be
dragged Hear us, Caesar. Let the false accusers be 6011-

be condemned to the lion. Hear us, Oaesar,” &c. See also

“ Antoninush the pious, the gods keep thee. Antoninus the
merciful, the gods keep thee. Antoninus the merciful, the gods

Those words savour of vain repetition in prayer, 1 Kings
xviii. 26; “ The priests of Baal called upon the name of Baal
from morning to noon, saying, Ο Baal, hear us.''

After the- same manner almost as the heathen mixed βατ-

words, but speaking the same thing in varied phrases; which
appears sufficiently to him that reads their liturgies through,
as well the more ancient as those of a later date. And cer-
tainly, the sin is equally the same in using different words of
the sai-ne thing, as in a vain repetition of the same w ords3 if
so be there weie the same deceit and hypocris) in both; in
words only multiplied, but the beart absent.

And in this matter the Jew sinned little less than the
heathen. For this was an axiom with 1116111,Π1ἾὮΠ ¹7:

Christ, therefore, does not so much condemn the baie εει)ἰι]ς

words of the same import (for he himself spake the same
things t-hrice, when 116, prayed 111 1116 garden), as a salse
opinion, as if there were some power, or zeal, 01· piety, in
such kind of repetitions; and that they would be sooner
