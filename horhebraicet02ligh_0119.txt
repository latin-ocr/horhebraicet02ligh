gated it to themselves, as their merit and due. But what do
they say of the common peopleZ “ This people, that knoweth
not the law, is cursed,'' John vii. 49.

Yon have a form of speaking, not much unlike this which
is now under our hands: *5732 &w 7:13) ἹἾἮΠῖὯ &vifis-Y
Hae that calls lm‘s 72ez'9lcbour Servant, let kim be in weom-
mum'eation„ The Gloss is, “ They therefore excommuni-
cate him, because he vilified an israelite ε him, therefore, they
vilify in like lnanner.”—D'''37:l“³·b23'7 ΠΝ new ἾἜῺῺ “Ifhe
call him bastard, let him be punished with forty stripes.
5³75ss *1722* ἻἻῬ :own If wichad onan, let it descend with him
into his life:'' that is, according to the Gloss, “into misery
and penury.'’

After this manner, therefore, our Saviour suits a different
punishment to different sins by a most just parity, and a very
equal compensation: to unjust anger, the just anger and
judgment of God; to public reproach, a publio trial; and
hell-fire to the censure that adjudgeth another thither.

Ver. 23: ‘'Oi-t ὁ ἀδελφός σου ἔχει τι κατὰ σοῦ, Sto. leat thy
brother laath oaylat ayainst thee, ege] The emphasis is chiefly
in the particle τι. For that Which the Jews restrained only
to pecuniary damageS, Christ extends to all offences against
our brother.

‘⁶ Hef that offers an oblation, not restoring that which he
had unjustly taken away, does not do that which is his (luty.''
And again3 ‘⁶ Heg that steals any thing from his neighbour,
yea, though it be but a farthing, and swears falsely, is bound
to restitution, meeting the wronged party half way.’' See
also Baal Turim upon Lev. vi.

oblation is not offered for a sin, unless that which is [wrong-
fully] taken away, be first restored either to the owner or the
priest.'' In like manner, “ H ei that swears falsely, either of
the Prata [small money] or what the Prata is worth, is
bound to inquire after the owner, even as far as the islands
in the sea, and to make restitution.'’

Observe, how provision is here made for pecuniary damages
