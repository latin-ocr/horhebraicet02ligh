Ch. xxvi. 34] Exercitations upon st. fllattlmw. 355

from the paschal supper, before it was done, to a market or
fair, was more unusual and strange than that it should be so
lightly passsed over by the disciples.

We, therefore, do not at all doubt that J udas was present
both at the Passover and the eucharist3 which Luke affirms
in direct words, chap. xxii. 20, 21 : nor do we doubt much of
his being present at the hymn, and that he went not away
before all was done: but when they all rose up from the
table, and prepared for their journey to mount Olivet (in

order to lie at Bethany, as the disciples supposed), the ·

villanous traitor stole away, and went to the company [00-
leortes], that he had appointed the priests two days before
to make ready for him at such a time and place, Methinks
I hear the words and consultations of this bloody wretch:
“ To-morrow (saith he) will be the Passover, and I know my
Master will come to it: l know he will not lie at Jerusalem,
but will go back to Bethany, however late at night, where he
is used to lie. Make ready, therefore, for me armed men,
and let them come to a place appointed immediately after
the paschal supper; and Ι will steal out privately to them
while my Master makes himself ready for his journey3 and I
will conduct them to seize upon him in the gardens without
the city, where, by reason of the solitariness of the place and
the silence of the night, we shall be secure enough from the
multitude. Doa ye make haste to despatch your passovers,
that you may meet together at the council after supper, to
examine and judge him, when we shall bring him to you;
while the silence of the night favours you also, and protects
you from the multitude.'' Thus, all things are provided
against the place and time appointed3 and the thief, stealing
away from the company of the disciples as they were going
out towards the mount of Olives and hastening to his armed
confederates without delay, brings them prepared along with
him, and sets upon his Master now in the garden.

Ver. 34: Πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι, τρὶς ἀπαρνήσῃ με· Βᾳΐονθ
the cocle crow, thou skalt dewy me thr-ica] The same also he
had said, John xiii. 38, “The cock shall* not crow till thou
hast denied me thrice.’' Therefore some say, that that was
the same supper with this of the Passover. V ery right, in-
