Behold! reader‚ a people very well contented to be deceived
with a new kind of Bam Kol. Compare these things with
Viryil's Zotsi, of which the Roman historialis speak frequently.
Not to be more tedicus therefore in this matter, let two
things only be observed: Ι. That the nation, under the
second Temple was given to magical arts beyond measure.
And, 2. That it was given to an easiness of believing all
manner of delusione beyond measure. And one may safely
suspect, that those voices which they thought to be from
heaven, and noted with the name of ,Bam Kol, were either
formed by the devil in the air to deceive the people, or by
magicians by devilish art to promote their own affairs.
Hence the apostle Peter saith with good reason, that “ the
word of prophecy was surer than a voice from heaven ;'‘
2 Pet. i. ¹9·

The very same which I judge of the Bam Κυί, is my
opinion also of the frequent appearances of Elias, with which
the leaves of the Talmud do every where abound; namely,
that in very many places the stories are false, and, in the rest,
the apparitions of him were diabolical. See the notes upon
the tenth verse of the seventeenth chapter.

OHAP. IV.

VER. 1 : Ἀυήχθη εἰς τὴν ἔρημον ὑπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματος πειρασ-
θῆναι, &c He was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be
tempted, ‹Ssc.] The war, proclaimed of old in Eden between
the serpent, and the seed of the serpent, and the seed of the
woman, Gen. iii. 15, now takes place; when that promised
seed of the woman comes forth into the field (being initiated
by baptism, and anointed by the Holy Ghost, unto the public
office of his ministry) to fight with that old serpent, and at
last to bruise his head. And, since the devil was always a
most impudent spirit, now he takes upon him a more har-
dened boldness than ever, even of waging war with him whom
he knew to be the Son of God, because from thatk ancient
proclamation of this war he knew well enough that he should
bruise his heel.
