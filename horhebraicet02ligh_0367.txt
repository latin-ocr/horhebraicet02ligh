Let them notjudgye on the eve of clm sabbath, nor osb the eve of a
feast dagh· which is also repeated in other places 2¹. The rea-
son of the prohibition is this, namely, that the trials which
were begun on the eve of the sabbath, or a feast day, should
not be finished on the sabbath or feast day. ‘⁴ Which indeed
(saith the Gloss), is observed in pecuniary trials, and care is
taken that there be no writing'' (for it is forbid to write so
much as a letter on the sabbath): “but in capital causes it
takes not place upon that account ; for the votes of those that
acquitted or condemned were written the day before.’'

You see in the history of the gospel9 1. The trial concerning
our Saviour's life, was not despatched at one and the same
sitting. 2. And that too on a feast-day.

Ver. 5: Ἀπήγξατο· Hcmgyed himself] Stranyulatas est, was
stranyled: namely, by the devil, who had now been in him
three days together. The words of Peter, Acts i. 18, (10 not
suffer me to understand this of hanging himself. Πρηυὴς
γενόμενος ἐλάκησε μέσος· Fama-q heacllony ke burst asmzder in
the midst. Interpreters take a great deal of pains to make
these words agree with his hanging himself ; but indeed all
will not do. I know the word ἀπήγξατο is commonly applied
to a man's hanyiny ltimseff, but not to exclude some other
way of stranqlingy. And I cannot but take the story (with
good leave of antiquity) in this sense: After J udas had thrown
down the money, the price of his treason, in the Temple, and
was now returning again to his mates, the devil, who dwelt
in him, caught him up on high, strangled him, and threw him
down headlong 3 so that dashing upon the ground, he burst
in the midst, and his guts issued out, and the devil went out
in so horrid an exit. This certainly agrees very well with the
words of Peter now mentioned, and also with those that fol-
low, “ This was known to all that dwelt at J erusalem.” It
agrees also very well with the deserts of the wicked wretch‚
and with the title of Iscariot. The wickedness he had com-
mitted was above all example, and the punishment he suf-
fered was beyond all precedent. There had been many in-
stances of persons who had hanged themselves 3 this would not
