come to pass, and of the signs going before, are firmer than
heaven and earth itself. But whereas ye inquire of the pre-
cise time, that¹ is not to be inquired after, for of that clay
and bour knoweth azo man.”

We cannot but remember here, that even among the be-
holders of the destruction of the Temple there is a difference
concerning the day of the destruction; that that day and
hour was so little known before the event, that even after
the event, they who saw the flames disagreed among them-
selves concerning the day. J oseph11S‚ an eyewit-ness, saw the
burning of the Temple, and he ascribed it to the tenth day of
the month Ab or Lous. For thus he23 “ The Temple perished
the tenth day of the month Lous (or Auyust), ab day fatal to
the Temple, as having been on that day consumed in flames
by the king of Babylon.” Rabban J ochanan Ben Zaccai saw
the same conflagrati0n3 and he, together with the whole
J ewish nation, ascribes it to the ninth day of that month, not
the tenth; yet so that he saith, “If Ι had not lived in that
age I had not judged it but to have happened on the tenth
day·” For as the Gloss upon Maimonidesc writes, “It was
the evening when they set fire to it, and the Temple burnt
until sunset the tenth day. In the Jerusalem Talmud‚ there-
fore, Rabbi and R. J oshua Ben Levi fasted the ninth and-
tenth dayS.'' See also the tract Bab. Taam'th d.
