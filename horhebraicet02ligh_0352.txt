346 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxvi. 24, &c.

Ver. 24. Καλὸν ἧν αὐτῷ, εἰ οὐκ ἐγεννήθη· It bad been qood
for kim {f he had not been borm] :Nam &¹727 ³³7 ru: Ita
were better for kim that he were not created. A very usual way
of speaking in the Talmudists.

Ver. 26. Λαβὼν ὁ Ἰησοῦς τὸν ἄρτου, διο. Jesus took bread, &ej
Bread at supper, the cup after supper: ‘⁶ After supper he took
the cup,'’ saith Luke, chap. xxii. 203 and Paul, 1 Gor. xi. 2 53
but not so of the bread.

That wc may more clearly perceive the history of this
supper in the evangelists, it may not be amiss to transcribe
the rubric of the paschal supper, with what brevity we can,
out of the Talmudists 3 that we may compare the things here
related with the custom of the nation.

I. The paschal supper began with a cup of wine: ‘⁶ Theyb
mingle the first cup for him. The school of Shammai saith,
He gives thanks, first for the day, and then for the wine:
but the school of Hillel saith, He first gives thanks for the
wine, and then for the day.'' The Shammeans confirm their
opinion, &ww {⁸³³7 mu 05*er Because the day is tlze cause
of their leaving] wine:” that is, as the Gloss explains it, &ww
ΠἺἾὩΕ) 0·le that they have it before meat. “Theyc first
mingle a cup for every one, and [the master of the faom'ly]
blesseth it; ‘ Blessed be he that created the fruit of the vine :'
and then he repeats the consecration of the day, 1235 [that
is, he gives thanks in the plural number for all the company,
saying‚ ⁶ Let us give thanks,'] and drinks up the cup. ‘⁶ And
afterward he blesseth concerning the washing of hands, and
washeth.'' Compare this cup with that, Luke xxii. 17.

II. Thend the bitter herbs are set on: ‘⁴ Theye bring in
a table ready covered, upon which there is ἿΠΝ ΡἾἾἹ ἾἸἾὈ
som· sauce and other herbs.” ΠἾἜΓῚΞ ³7:²20 ³³:2³7 iwan

siffis-if nume& amm> '737 Let the Glossersg give the in-
terpretation: “They do not set the table till after the conse-

cration of the day: and upon the table they set lettuce.
After he hath blessed over the wine, they set herbs, and he
eats lettuce dipped, but not in ΠῠἾἾΠ the som· sance, for that
