3. Marcus Ambibuchus [Ambivius] succeeds Coponius.

4. Annius Rufust succeeds Ambibuchus [Ambivius], during
whose presidentship Augustus dies.

Since, therefore, only sourteen years passed from the na-
tivity of Christ to the death of Augustus, out of which sum
when you shall have reckoned the ten years current of Ar„
chelaus, and the times of the three presidents, we must reckon
that Christ was not born but in the last years of Herod. Thus
we conjecture:

In his thirty-fifth Christ was born.

In his thirty-seventh, now newly begun, the wise men earne :
presently after this was the slaying of the infants; and, after
a few months, the death of Herod.

IV. Christ was born about the twenty-seventh year of the
presidentship of Hillel in the Sanhedrim.

from the stock of David, by his wife Abital.’' Now Hillel went
up out of Babylon to Jerusalem, to inquire of the wise men
concerning some things, when now, after the death of Shemaia
and Abtalion, the two sons of Betira held the chief seats.
And when he who had resorted thither to learn something,
had taught them some things of the Passover rites, which
they had forgot, they put him into the chair. You have the
full story of it in the Jerusalem Talmud X. We mention it
chap. xxvi. 1.

Now Hillel went up to Jerusalem and took the chair a
