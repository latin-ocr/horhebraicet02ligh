worship of heaven .- &mm-1 manno: bf! tlte help of heaven,

his habitation is in heaven.''

The story of the Jews is related, groaning out under their
persecution these words, 1:2³0& ³& O Heavens! that is, as
the Gloss renders it, ΗΠ nrm Ala! Jelzovah!

II. This y manner of speech, the kingya'om of heaven, is
taken from Daniel, chap. vii. 13, 143 where, after the de-
scription of the four earthly and tyrannical monarchies‚ that
is, the Babylonian, Mede-Persian, Grecian, and Syro-Grecian,
and the destruction of them at last 3 the entrance and nature
of the reign of Christ is described, as it is universal over the
whole world, and eternal throughout all ages ε “ under whom
the rule, and dominion, and authority of kingdoms under the
whole heaven is given to the people of the saints of the Most
High‚'' ver. 27: that is, “Whffl-eas, before, the rule had been
in the hands of heathen kings, under the reign of Christ
there should be Christian kings.” Unto which that of the
apostle hath respect, 1 Cor. vi. 23 ‘⁶ Know ye not that the
saints shall judge the world 3³³

Truly I admire that the fulfilling of that vision and pro-
phecy in Daniel should be lengthened out still into I know
not what long and late expectation, not to receive its com-
pletion before Rome and antichrist shall fall; since the books
of the Gospel afford us a commentary clearer than the sun,
that that kiozqdom of heaven took its beginning immedi-
ately upon the preaching of the Grospel. When both the
Baptist and Christ published the approach of the kinydom
qf 'heaven from their very first preaching3 certainly, for any
to think that the fulfilling of those things in Daniel did not
then begin, for my part, I think it is to grope in the dark,
either through wilfulness or ignorance.

ΙΙΙ. The kinydom of heaven implies, 1. The exhibition
and manifestation of the Messias, Matt. xii. 28 3 ‘⁶ But if I,
by the finger of God, cast out devils, the kingdom of God is
come upon you :” that is, ‘ Hence is the manifestation of the
Messias? See John iii. 3, xii, 13, Sec. 2. The resurrection
of Christ; death, hell, Satan, being conquered: whence is a
