Ch. ix, 2.] Exercitations upon St. Δίαν-11. 4523

saith to the thing, reveal my doubts concerning it: and the
reader, laying before his eyes some geographical map of
Galilee, perhaps, when he shall have heard me, will judge
more favourably of my doubting.

I. Let him consider that Christ, in the story next going
before, was 111 1110 coast of Caesarea Philippi, Matt. xvi. 13 3
Mark viii. 273 Luke ix. 183 and, for any thing that can be
gathered out of the evangelists, changed not his place before
this story. Who will deny that those words, “ There are
some that stand here who shall not taste of death}5 &e., were
uttered in those coasts of Caesarea Philippi? And presently
the story of the transfiguration followed.

ΙΙ. Six days indeed came between: in which, you will
say, Christ might travel from Caesarea Philippi to Tabor.
He might, indeed: but, 1. The evangeliste intimate no change
from place to place, saying only this, That he led up into
the mountain three of his disciples. 2. Ι1 0001110, indeed, a
wonder that our Saviour would tire himself with so long a
journey, to choose Tabor whereon to be transfigured, when,
as far as we read, he had never before been in that mountain3
and there were mountains elsewhere where he conversed fre-
quently. 3. Follow the footsteps of the history, and of
Christ in his travel‚ from 1110 transfiguration onwards. 'When
he came down from the mountain, he healed a child possessed
with a devil: and when he betook himself into the house
they said, “ Why could not we east out the devil? &c And
they departed thence, and passed through Galilee, and came
to Capernaum,'' Mark ix. 28, 30, 33.

III. And now, reader, look upon the chorographical map,
and how incongruous will this travelling seem! Ι. From
Caesarea Philippi to mount Tabor through the whole length
almost of Galilee. 2. Then from mount Tabor by a course
back again to Capernaum, a great part of Galilee (espe-
cially as the maps place Capernaum) being again passed
over. Whereas Capernaum was in the way from Caesarea
Philippi to Tabor‚ and there was a mountain there well known
to Christ, and very much frequented by him.

IV. Soc that it seems far more consonant 10 the history of
the gospeL that Christ was transfigured in some mountain
