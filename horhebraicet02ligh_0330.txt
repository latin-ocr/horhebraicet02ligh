ᾅο] 'Phe lord did not deliver the talents to his servants with
that intent, that they should receive the increase and profit
of them by usury; but that, by merchandise and some honest
way of trade, they should increase them. He only returns
this answer to the slothful servant, as fitted to what he had
alleged: “ You take me for a commus, griping‚ and sordid
man: why then did you not make use of a manner of gain
agreeable to these qualities, namely, interest or usury (since

the employment of a usurer in buying and changing of fruits,
as the other in money: for in these two especially consisted
usury: of which you may see, if you please, the tract Βαυα
Mezian.
