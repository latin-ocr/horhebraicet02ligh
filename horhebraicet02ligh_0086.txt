priests, who were initiated by washing and anointing; so was
he by baptism, and the Holy Ghost. ΙΙ. When, by the in-
stitution of Christ, those that entered into the profession of
the gospel were to be introduced by baptism, it was just,
yea, necessary, that Christ, being to enter into the same
profession, and to preach it too, should be admitted by
baptism.

Ι. That Christ conversed upon earth two-and-thirty years and
a half (as many years as David lived at J erusalem; compare
· 2 Sam. v. 5), is proved hence :——1. That he was baptized when
he had now completed his twenty-ninth year, and had newly
begun his thirtieth. That the words of Luke imply, ὡσεὶ ἐτῶυ
τριάκουτα ἀρχόμενος ὤν· He heyam to be about thirty years old.
Which words, although they are applied by some Christians
to Ι know not what large latitude,—yet in the J ewish schools‚
and among that naffion, they would not admit, certainly, of
another sense than we produce. For therey this axiom holds,

reclconed for that year. And, questionless, Luke speaks with
the vulgar. For let it be supposed that the evangelist uttered
these words in some J ewish school, “ N. was baptized ἀρχό-
μενος ὢν ὡσεὶ τριάκοντα ἐτῶν, beyinniny to be about thirty years
old:” how could it be understood by them of the thirtieth
complete (much less of the thirty-first, or thirty-second, as
some wrest ia? when the words ἀρχόμενος ὡσεὶ, beyinninq to
be about, do so harmoniously agree with the said axiom‚ as
scarcely any thing can do more clearly. 2. That, from his
baptism to his OPOSS, he lived three years and a half. This is
intimated by the angel Gabriel, Dan. ix. 27 ; ⁶⁶ In the half of
a week” (that is, in three years and a half) ‘⁶ he shall make
the sacrifice and oblation to cease 3⁶⁵ and it is confirmed from
the computation in the evangelists, but especially in John,
who clearly mentioneth four Passovers (chap. ii. 13, v. 1, vi. 4,
and xiiia) after his forty days' fast, and not a little time spent
in Galilee. -

ΙΙ. Therefore, we suppose Christ was baptized about the
feast of Tabernacles‚ in the month Tisri, at which time we
