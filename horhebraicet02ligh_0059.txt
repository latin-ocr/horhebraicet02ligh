the reqion round about Jordan. Strabo r, concerning the plain
bordering on Jordan, hath these words; “ It is a placo of a

ξ. Α fiw thinys concerniny Baptism.

Ver. 6 ε Καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο· And were baptizati] It is no unfit
or unprofitable question, Whence it came to pass that there
was so great a conflux of men to the Baptist, and so ready a
reception of his baptism?

Ι. The first reason is, Because the manifestation of the
Messias was then expected, the weeks of Daniel being now
spent to the last four years. Let us consult a little his
text :—-

Dan. ix, 24. “ Seventy weeks [of years] are decreed concern-
ing thy people,'' &c. That is, four hundred and ninety years,
from the first of Cyrus to the death of Christ. These years
are divided into three parts, and they very unequal.

1. Into seven weeks, or forty-nine years, from the giving of
Cyrus's patent for the rebuilding Jerusalem, to the finishing
the rebuilding of it by N ehemiah.

2. Into sixty-two weeks, or four hundred thirty-four years,
——namely‚ from the finishing the building of the city to the
beginning of the last week of the seventy. In which spaceS of
time, the times of the Persian empire (which remained after
Nehemiah, if indeed there was any time now remaining), and
the times of the Grecian empire, and of the Syro-Grecian,
were all run out, and those times also, wherein the Romans
ruled over the Jews.

3. The holy text divides the last week, or the last seven
years, into two equal parm, ver. 273 which I thus render;
‘⁶ And he shall stmngthen, or confirm, the covenant with
many in that one week: and the half of that week shall make
the sacrifice and oblation to cease: ον, in the half of that
week he shall make to cease,'' &c. , Not in the middle of that
week, but in the latter half, that is, the latter three years and
a half of the seven.
