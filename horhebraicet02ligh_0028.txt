for this is their tongue.''

Mark, the Hebrew was altogether unknown to the common
people: no wonder, therefore, if the evangelists and apostles
wrote not in Hebrew when there were none who understood
things so written, but learned men only.

That also must not be passed over, which, at first sight,
seems to hint that the Syriae language was not understood
even by learned men. “ Samuel the Little U, at the point of
death, said, &zur-1³7 &3417an pynw Simeon ancl Ismael to
tlze 8200cm ,· ΠτῈῙὮ &ny ³72 ἾΝΨἸ aad all the other people co tlte

spoke these tlzinqs in me Syriae lawyuaqe, they understood not
what he had said. This story you have repeated in the Ba-

R.. Ohananiah Ben Teradion wore slain by other deaths;
namely R. Akibah by iron teeth‚ and R. Ohananiah by
burning alive before idols]; and the other people for a prey:
and very many calamities shall fall upon tlce world?

Now where it is said that, ‘⁶ They understood not what he
said, because he spake in the Syrian tongue,” we also do not
easily understand. What! for the Jerusalem doctors not
to understand the Ohaldee language! For Samuel the Little
died before the destruction of the oity3 and he spake of the
death of Rabban Simeon, who perished in the siege of the
city3 and he spake these things when some of the learnedest
Rabbins were by: and yet that they understood not these
words, which even a sma‘tterer in the oriental tongues would
very easily understand l
