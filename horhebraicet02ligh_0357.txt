ΙΙΙ. The measure of these cups is thus determinedp:

Chaia saith, Four caps comam em Italian quart of minem
And more exactly in the same place: “How much is the

have in the Babylonian Talmud at the place before quoted,

only with this difference, that instead of 3722& 127⁸th the third

with water, he laath performed lois cluty‚· but commonly they
mingled water with it: hence, when there is mention of wine
in the rubric of the feam, they always use the word '121'572
they minyle him a cup. Concerning that mingling, both
Talmudists dispute in the forecited chapter of the Passover:
which see. “ Thet Rabbins have a tradition. Over wine
which hath not water mingled with it they do not say that
blessing‚ ‘ Blessed be He that created the fruit of the vine ;'
but, ‘ Blessed be he that created the fruit of the tree.’ '’ The
Gloss, *mm ,ἮΠ ΞΒἿἿ Their wine was very strony, and not fit
to be drunk without water‚'’ Sec. The Gemarists a little
after: “ The wise agree with R. Eleazar, ‘ That one ought
not to bless over the cup of blessing till water be mingled
with it.''' The mingling of water with every cup was re-
quisite for health, and the avoiding of drunkenness. We
have before taken notice of a story of Rabban Gamaliel, who
found and confessed some disorder of mind, and unfitness for
serious buisness, by having drunk off an Italian quart of wine.
