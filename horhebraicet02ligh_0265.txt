Ver. 21 z Ἀφήσω αὐτῷ; ἕως ἑπτάκις; Shalb I foryive him?
till seven times ἓ] This question of Peter respects the words
of our Saviour‚ ver. 15. “ How sar shall I forgive my brother
before I proceed to the extremity? What! seven times3”
He thought that he had measured out, by these words, a
large charity, being, in a manner, double to that which was
prescribed by the schools: “ Hee that is wronged (say they)
is forbidden to be difficule to pardon3 for that is not the
manner of the seed of Israel. But when the offender im-
plores him once and again, and it appears he repents of his
deed, let him pardon him: and whosoever is most ready to
pardon is most praiseworthy.” It is wellf; but there lies a
snake under it; “ For (say theyg) they pardon a man once,
that sins against another3 secondly, they pardon him;
thirdly, they pardon l1im; fourthly‚ they do not pardon
him,'' 850.

VER. Ι : ςΗλθεν εἰς τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου·
He came nnto the coasts ofJudea beyond Jordan] If it were
barely said, ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, tlte coasts
of Jadea beyond Jordan, by the coasts of Judea one might un-
derstand tlte bound-s· of tbe Jews beyond Jordan. Nor does such
a construction want its parallel in J osephus ; for “ Hyrcanus
(saith hei) built a fortification, the name of which was Tyre‚
μεταξὺ τῆς τε Ἀραβίας καὶ τῆς Ἰουδαίας πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, οὐ
πόρρω τῆς Ἐσσεβωνίτιδος, between Arabia and Jadea, beyond
Jordan, not fier from Essebonitis.” But see Mark here, chap.
x. 1, relating the same story with this our evangelist: Ἔρχε-
ται εἷς τὰ ὅρια τῆς Ἰουδαίας, διὰ τοῦ πέραν τοῦἸορδάνου· He came,
saith he, into the coasts of Judea, (taking a joui-ney from Gali-
lee,) along] the country beyond Jordan.

Ver. 3 τ Εἰ ἔξεστιν ἀνθρώπῳ ἀπολῦσαι τὴν γυναῖκα αὐτοῦ κατὰ
πᾶσαν αἰτίαν; Is it law-ful for a man to put away his wife for
every cause ἒ] Of the causes, ridiculous (shall I call them ?) or
wicked, for which they put away their wives, we have spoke
at chap. v. 31. We will produce only one example here;
