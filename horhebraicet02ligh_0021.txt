king. It was therefore needful, in setting down his genea-
logy, that satisfaction should be given concerning both.
Therefore Lulze declareth him the promised seed of the
woman, deducing his mother's stock, from whence man was
born, from Adam 3 Matthew exhibits his royal original, de-
riving his pedigree along through the royal family of David to
J oseph, his (reputed) father.

Ver.17: Γενεαὶ δεκατέσσαρες· Fourteen yenerations. Al-
though all things do not square exactly in this threefold
number of fourteen yenerations, yet there is 110 reason why
this should be charged as a fault upon Matthew, when in the
J ewish schools themselves it obtained for a custom‚ yea,
almost for an axiom‚ to reduce things and numbers to the
very same, when they were near alike. The thing will be
plain by an example or two, when a hundred almost might be
produced.

Five calamitous things are ascribed to the same day, that
is, to the ninth day of the month Ab. “ For that day (say
they b) it was decreed, T hat the people should not go into the
promised land: the same day, the first Temple was laid
waste, and the second also: the city Bitter was destroyed,
and the city Jerusalem ploughed up.'' Not that they believed
all these things fell out precisely the same day of the month;
but, as the Babylonian Gemara notes upon it, mm ζ’ἶῖλῖἳλῖἓ

The Jerusalem Gemarac, in the same tract, examines the
reason why the daily prayers consist of the number of eighteen,
and among other things hath these words; “ The daily
prayers are eighteen, according to the number of the eighteen
Psalms, from the beginning of the Book of Psalms to that
Psalm whose beginning is, ‘ The Lord hear thee in the day of
trouble,''’ [which Psalm‚ indeed, is the twentieth Psalm]
“ But if any object, that nineteen Psalms reach thither, you
may answer, The Psalm which begins, ⁶ Why did the heathen
rage,' is not of them,” a distinct Psalm. Behold, with what
liberty they fit numbers to their own case.
