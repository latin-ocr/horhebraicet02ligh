Oh. xxiv. 7.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 311

send to you my messenger, and he shall prepare the way be-
fore my faeek? ’³

See here the doctrine of the Jews concerning the coming of
the Messiah :

1. That at that time there shall be a resurrection of the
just: tany ἾΠἾΠἿ ζ’]ἾἿῙὮ ἾἾΓΨ rhum The Messias shall mise
up those that sleep in the clustl.

2. Then shall follow the desolation of this world: 03¹7&
0⁸:11> Hb& ΞἾΠ ru This world shall be wastecl a thousand
years. Not that they imagined that a chaos, or confusion of
all things, should last the thousand years3 but that this world
should end and a new one be introduced in that thousand
years.

3. After which &5:³7 *l'fly eternitgq should sueceecl.

From hence we easily understand the meaning of this ques-
tion of the disciples :—

1. They know and own the present Messiah3 and yet they
ask, what shall be the signs of his coming?

2. But they do not ask the signs of his coming (as we be-
lieve of it) at the last day, to judge both the quick and the
dead: but,

3. When he will come in the evidence and demonstration of
the Messiah, raising up the dead, and ending this world, and
introducing a new3 as they had been taught in their schools
concerning his coming.

Ver. 7: Ἐγερθήσεται γὰρ ἔθνος ἐπὶ ἔθνος· Nation shall risa
ayainst natica] Resides the seditions of the Jews, made hor-
ridly bloody with their mutual slaughter, and other storms of
war in the Roman empire from strangers‚ the commotioris of
Otho and Vitellius are particularly memorable, and those of
Vitellius and Vespasian‚ whereby not only the whole empire
was shaken, ancl “ totius orbis mutatione fortuna imperii
transiit'' (they are the words of Tacitus), the fortune of the
empire chanyeol with. the ckanye of the whole world, but Rome
itself being made the scene of battle, and the prey of the
soldiers, and the Capitol itself being reduced to ashes. Such
throes the empire suffered, now bringing forth Vespasian to
the throne, the scourge and vengeance of God upon the
Jews.
