ΙΙ. But however it was, whether those things were true
indeed, or only believed and conceived so, by a most apt and
open comparison is shown that the devil was first cast out of
the J ewish nation by the gospel3 and then, seeking for a seat

heathen ended in sables. It is said, in the place of the

Talmud just now cited, &Sum new: 4:12³: '²72³ mm
