mara3 “The first Temple stood four hundred and ten years,
and there were not above eighteen priests under it. The
second stood four hundred and twenty years, and there were
more than three hundred under it. Take out forty years of
Simeon the Just, eighty of Jochanan, ten of Ismael Ben
Phabi, and eleven of Eleazar Ben Harsum, and there doth
not remain one whole year to eaeh of the rest.”

Behold the chamber of the βουλευτῶν, σοπηεεῖἰονε, properly
so called, because the priests did meet and sit there not to
judge, but to consult; and that only of things belonging to
the Temple! Here they consulted, and took care that all
persons and things belonging and necessary to the worship
of God should be in readiness3 that the buildings of the
Temple and the courts should be kept in repair3 and that
the public Liturgy should be duly performed: but in the
meantime they wanted all power of judgingg and punishing;
they had no authority to fine, scourge, or put to death, yea,
and in a word, to exercise any judgment3 for by their own
examination and authority they could not admit a candi-
date into the priesthood, but he was admitted by the author-
ity of the council: “ Ιῐιὴ the chamber Gazith sat the council
of Israel, and held the examinations of priests: whosoever
was not found fit was sent away in black clothes, and a black
veil; whosoever was found fit was clothed in white, and had
a white veil, and entered and ministered with his brethren the
priests.''
