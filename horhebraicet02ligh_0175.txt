Ch. ix. 14] Esercz'mtzbns upon St. Matthem 169

Maculam] Five disciples of Christ are mentioned by the
Tahnuffists, among whom Matthew seems to be named :
“ Thed Rabbins deliver, There were five disciples of Jesus‚
ΠἾἾΠἸ *Um '³22 ‘'Npl 'NDD Mathai, Nakai, Nazer, and
Boni, and Tkodalzf’ These, they relate, were led out and
killed. See the place. Perhaps five are only mentioned by
them, because five of the disciples were chiefly employed
among the Jews in Judea: namely, Matthew who wrote his
Grospel there, Peter, J ames, John2 and J udas,

Matthew seems to have sat in the custom-house of Caper-

tomary in it to write two letters greater than ours.” See also
the Gemara there.

the Pharisees fast oft] Monsters, rather than stories‚ are
related of the Pharisees' fasts :—

I. It is known to all, from Luke xviii. 12, that they were
wont to fast twice every week‚ The rise of which custom
you may fetch from this tradition: ‘⁶ Ezraf decreed ten
decrees. He appointed the public reading of the law the
second and fifth days of the week : and again on the sabbath
at the Mincka [or eveniny service} He instituted the session
of the judges in cities on the second and fifth days of the
week‚” &a Of this matter discourse is had elsewhere : “ If g
you ask the reason why the decree was made concerning the
second and fifth days, Sec„ we must answer, saith the Gloss,
from that which is said in Midras concerning Moses; namely,
that he went up into the mount to receive the second tables
on the fifth day of the week‚ and came down, God being now
appeased, the second day. When, therefore, that ascent and
descent was a time of grace, they so determined of the second
