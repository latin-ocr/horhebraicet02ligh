4 DEDICATION.

and reveal all Jewish matters3 being induced by these rea-
sons, I applied myself chiefly to the reading these books. Ι
knew, indeed, well enough, that I must certainly wrestle with
infinite difficulties, and such as were hardly to be overcome3
yet I undervalued them all, and armed myself with a firm
purpose, that, if it were possible, Ι might arrive to a fuller
and more deep knowledge and understanding of the style and
dialect of the New Testament.

The ill repert of those authorS, whom all do so very much
spen-k against, may, at first, discourage him that sets upon
the reading of their books. The Jews themselves stink in
Marcellinus& and their writings stink as much amongst all;
and they labour under this I know not what singular mis- Ι
fortune, that, being not read, they displease; and that they
are sufficiently reproached by those that have read them, but
undergo much more infamy by those that have not.

The almost unconquerable difficulty of the style, the
night-ful ronghness of the language, and the amazing empti-
ness and sophistry of the matters handled, do torture, vex,
and tire him that reads them. They do everywhere abound
with trifles in that manner, as though they had no mind to be
read ; with obscurities and difficulties, as though they had no
mind to be understood: so that the reader bath need of
patience all along, to enable him to bear both trifiing in sense
and roughness in expression.

1, indeed, propounded three things to myself while I turned
them over, that 1 might, as much as I could, either under-
ruluc those vexations of reading, or soften them, or recreate
myself with them, and that I might reap and enjoy fruit from
them, if Ι could, and as 11111011 as I could.

I. I resolved with mysolf to observe those things which
seemod to yield some light to the holy Scriptures, but espe-
cially either to the phraseS‚ or sentences, or history of the
New Testament.

l 1. To set down such things in my note-books, which car-
ried some mention ofc certain places in the land of Israel,
or afforded ‘¹ some light into the chorography of that land.
