Oh. xxi. 33, 35] Emercitatz'ons upon St. M‘attlaeoe. 283

This is a hyperbolieal way of speaking, taken from the common
language of the 80110018 of the Jews, and designedr after a
manner for their refutation. Such a hyperbole eoneerning
this very mountain you have Zech. xiv. 4.

The Jews used to set out those teaehers among them, that
were more eminent for the profoundness of their learning, or
the splendour of their virtues, by such expressions as this;
ΠἾἾΠ *ip'ly &Tr He is α rooter up (or α remover) of moun-
tains. “ RabhS J oseph is Sinai, and Rabbah is a rooter up of
mountains.’' The Gloss; “They called Rabh Joseph Sinai,
because he was very skilful in elearing os difficulties3 and
Rabbah Bar Nachmani, A rooter up of mozmtains, because
he had a piereing judgment.’' “ Rabbat said, I am like Ben
Azzai in the 8110018 of Tiberias.” The Gloss3 “ Like Ben
Azzai, who taught profoundly in the streets of Tibe1·ias; nor
was there in his days inm: ΞἾἾΠ ‘'ip‘iy such anot-her room-
τῳ Qf mountain-s· as hes “Heu saw Resh Lachish in the
school, as if he were pluckiny up mozmtains and grinding them
one upon anothe1·.”

The same expression with which they sillily and fiatteringly
extolled the learning and virtue of their men, Christ deserv-
edly useth to set forth the power of saith, as able to do
all things, Mark ix. 23.

Ver. 33: Ἐφύτευσευ ἀμπελῶνα· Plcmted cc vineyard] Con-
001111ηὲ vines and 111011 husbandry see Kilai1n³<‚ where there
is a large discourse of the beds of a vineyard‚ the orders of
the vines, of the measure of the 111111οΡ1088, of 1110 hedge, of
the 1101101108, of the void space, of the places within the hedge
which were free from vines, whether they were to be sown or
not to be sown, 810.

Ver. 35: ’Έδειραυ, beat 5 ἀπέκτειναν, killed ,· ἐλιθοβόλησαν,
stoned] There seems 10 be an allusion to the punishments
and manners of death in the couneil : 1. Ἔδειραυ, which pro-
perly signifies the flayiny off of the skira, is not amiss rendered
by interpreters beat; and the word seems to relate to wkip-
piny, where forty stripes save 0110 did miserably flay qff' the
skin of the poor man. See what the word :imo properly
