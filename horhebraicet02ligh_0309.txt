Hear both the TalmudsC : “ R. J oohanan said, Eighty thou-
sand priests were killed for the blood of Zacharias. R. J udah
asked R. Acha, ‘ thereabouts they killed ZachariaS, whether
in the Court of the Women, or in the Court of Israel ξ’ He
answered, ‘ Neither in the Court of Israel nor in the Court
of the Women, but in the Oourt of the Priests.' And that
was not done to his blood which useth to be done to the
blood of a ram or a kid. Concerning these it is written,
‘And 110 shall pour out his blood, and cover it with dust.’
But herc it is written, ⁶ Herd blood is in the midst of hel-3

he brought the young priests, and slew them upon it, and yet
it was not quiet. So that he slew upon it ninety-four thou-
