hundred who went to the battle would not impart the spoils
to the two hundred who were faint and weary; Ἀγαπήσειυ δὲ

In some parity of sense, John is called the disciple, ὃν ἠγάπα
ὁ Ἰησοῦς, whom Jeszcs loved ,· not that J esus loved him more
than the rest with his eternal, infinite, saving love, but he
favoured him more with some outward kindness and more
intimate friendship and familiarity. And why? Because John
had promised that he would take care of Christ's mother after
his death. For those words of our Saviour upon the cross to
John, ‘ Behold thy mother !' and to his mother, ‘ Behold thy
son !’ and that from thence John took her home, do carry a
fair probability with them, that that was not the first time
that John heard of such a matter, but that long before he had
so promised.

by making a tautology: for it was neither necessary, as they
think, so to render the Syriae word in Greek3 nor is it done
so elsewhere in proper names of that nature. For it is not
