Ch. xvii. 5, 10] hweroicatioas upon St. Matthew. 245

come and discourse with him concerning his death (it is un-
certain how long)‚ while as yet the disciples that were present
were overcharged with sleep. When they awaked, O what a
spectacle had they! being afraid, they observe and contem
plate, they discover the prophets: whom, now departing,
Peter would detain 3 and being loath that so noble a scene
should be dispersed, made this proposition, “ Let us make
here three tabemaclesss' Sco. Whence he should know them
to be prophets, it is in vain to seek‚ because it is nowhere to
be found; but being known, he was loath they should depart
thence, being ravished with the sweetness of such society,
however astonished at the terror of the glory3 and hence
those words, which when 116 spake he is said by Luke “not
to know what he said 3⁵⁹ and by Mark‚ “ not to know what
he should say ;” which are rather to be understood of the
misapplication of his words, than of ‚the sense of the words.
He knew well enough that he said these words, and he
knew as well for what reason he said them3 but yet “ he
knew not what he said ;'' that 16, 116 was much mistaken
when he spake these words, while he believed that Christ,
Moses, and Elias, would abide and dwell there together in
earthly tabernacles.

Ver. 5: Ἔτι αὐτοῦ λαλοΰυτος, ἰδοὺ, νεφέλη, 816. While he yet
spahc, behold, a cloud, dm] Moses and Elias now turning thei r
hacke, and going out of the scene, Peter speaks his words3
-and as he speaks them when the prophets were now gone,
“ Behold, a cloud‚'' 816. They had foretold Christ of his death
(such is the cry of the Law and of the ProphetS, that ‘⁶ Christ
should suffer,'⁷ Luke xxiv. 44); he preaehes his deity to hisz
disciples, and the heavenly voice seals him for the true Mes-
sias. See 2 Pet. i. 16, 17.

Ver. 10³: Τί οὖν οἱ γραμματεῖς λέγουσιν, ὅτι ἹῚλίαν δεῖ
ἐλθεῖν πρῶτον; Why therefore say the scribes that Elias must
first come ξ’] Ι. Ι1 would be an infinite task to produce all
the passages out of the Jewish writings which one might
concerning the expected coming of Elias: we will mention a
few things ἐν παρόδῳ, in passiny, which sufficiently speak out
that vain expectation, and the ends also of his expected
coming.
