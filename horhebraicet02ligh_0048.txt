42 Hem-ew and Talmudical [Ch. ii. 14.

of which J osephus writes b, and both Talmudsc ε “ When
Simeon the Just said, ‘ I shall die this year‚’ they said to him,
‘ Whom, therefore, shall we put in thy place 3³ He answered,
:piru-1: ³32 ΠΣΠ ‘ Behold l mg] son Onias is before you? They
made Onias therefore high-priest. But his brother Simeon
envied him. Onias, therefore, fied, first into the Royal Moun-
tain, and then into Egypt, and built there an altar, repeating
that of the· prophet, ‘ In that day there shall be an altar to
the Lord in the midst of Egypt.'”

“ Hed that hath not seen the cathedral church of Alexan-
dria hath never seen the glory of Israel. It was after the
manner of a court-walk‚ double cloistered. There were some-
times there so many as doubly exceeded the number of those
that went out of Egypt. There were seventy golden chairs
set with gems, according to the number of the severity elders.
A wooden pulpit also placed in the middle, in which the
bishop of the synagogue stood. And when the law was read,
after every benediction, a sign being given by a private person
waving a handkerchief, they all answered ‘Amen’ But they
sat not confusedly and mixedly together; but every artificere
with the professors of the same art: so that if a stranger
came, he might mingle himself with the workmen of the same
trade, aa. These did wicked Trajan destroy,'’ &c

The Babylonian Gomaraf repeats almost the same things,
alleging these last matters after this manner: ‘⁶ They sat not
confusedly‚ but the artificers by themselves, the silversmiths
by themselves, the braziers by themselves, the weavers by
themselves, ὄιος so that if a poor stranger came in, he might
know his own fellow-workmen, and betake himself to them,
and thence receive sustenance for himself and family.

So provision was made for the poverty of J oseph and Mary,
while they sojourned in Egypt (at Alexandria, probably),
partly by selling the presents of the wise men for food and
provision by the way3 and partly by a supply of victuals from
their country-folks in Egypt when they had need.

There are some footsteps in the Talmudists of this jour-
ney of our Saviour into Egypt, but so corrupted with venom-
