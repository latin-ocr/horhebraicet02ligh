clean; he that was otherwise, was not. Levit. xiii. 125 “ If
the leprosy shall cover the whole body from head to foot,
thou 511311 pronounce him clean,” &Q A law certainly to be
wondered at! Is he not clean, till the whole body be in-
fected and covered with the leprosy? Nor 511311 111011, Ο 5111-
1161, be made clean without the like condition. Either ac-
knowledge thyself 311 over leprous‚ or thou 511311 1101 be
cleansed.

Ver. 3: ’Ήψατο αὐτοῦ ὁ Ἰησοῦς· Jeszcs touched kim] It was
indeed a wonder, that when the leprosy was a creeping infec-
tion, the priest‚ when he judged of it, was not hurt with the
infection. It cannot be passed over without observation, that
Aaron, being bound under the same guilt with Miriam, bore
not the same punishment : for she was touched with leprosy,
he not, Num. xii. And also that Uzziah should be confuteds
concerning his encroaching upon the priesthood no other way
than by the plague of leprosy. In him Grod would magnify
the priesthood, 11131 was to judge of the leprosy3 and he
would shew the other was no priest, by his being touched
with the leprosy. It can scarcely be denied‚ indeed, that
the priests sometimes might be touched with that plague;
but certainly they catched not the contagion while they
were doing their office in judging of it. This is a noble
doctrine of our High Priest, the J udge and Physician of our
leprosy, while he 1611131115 wholly untouched by it. How much
does he surpass that miracle of the Levitical priesthood!
They were not touched by the contagion when they touched
the leprous person3 he, by his touch, heals him that 113111
1116 infection.

Ver. 4: “Ὑπαγε, σεαυτὸν δεῖξον τῷ ἱερεῖ, 816. Go, show thyself
to the priest, Sca] I. Our Saviour would not have the extra-
ordinary manner whereby he was healed discovered to the
priest, that 116 might pay 1116 ordinary duty of his cleansing.
And surely it deserves no slight consideration, that he sends
him 10 1116 priest. However now the priesthood was too de-
generate both from its institution and its office, yet he would
reserve to it its privileges, while he would reserve the priest-
hood itself. Corruption‚ indeed, defiles a divine institution,
but extinguishes it not.
