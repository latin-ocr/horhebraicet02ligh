preparas for a feast day. “Butf those reasons do not hold
good :³³:227 ἾἹΟΝΚ) to forbid the preparatione, while as yet
there remains much of the day :'' ΠΞΞΠ, παρασκευὴ, ΡΜ·
paration.''

But you will say, “If a feast day prepares not for the
sabbath (which Maimonides saith), such an interpretation
will not suit with the words which we are now handling, that
it should be called the preparation, in respect of provisions
prepared for the sabbath on that day. Let the masters
themselves answer.

211an :ny ΠἾἿΠὶῖ &rw :m [W “ Onh a feast day,
which happens on the sabbath eve, let not a man in the begin-
ning seethe food after the feast day for the sabbath day, but
let him seethe for the feast day, and if any remam, let it be

reserved for the sabbath. But ‘v'wzn nw'ssff (according to

the letter, Let kim make a boiliwsy, but the sense is) “ Let
kim prepare fhod on the eve of the feast day, and let him
depend upon it for the sabbath. The school of Shammai
saith, ΓῖῬῐΠἎΓὶ Um, a twofold foed .· that of Hillel saith,
One food.’'

Maimonides speaksi plainer: “ On a feast day that falls
in with a sabbath eve, they do not bake nor seethe on the
feast day what they eat on the sabbath. And this prohi-
bition is from the¹ words of the scribes: namely, That none
seethe on a feast day for a common day; for this is arguing
a majori acl minus, from the yreater to the less: if a man
seethe not for the sabbath day, much less for a common day.
But if he provides food on the eve of the feast day, on which
ke may depeozd (vlvy ἹὈἹΒΨ), then if he bake or seethe on
the feast day for the sabbath, it is permitted: and that on
which he depends is called Jfflv'wlfl mnu> tlze mimae ⁰f
food. And why is it called ΞἾἾἾὩ mioeiny [συναυάμιξις, a min-
yliny toyetkenj? namely, as that mioeiny which they make con-
cerning the conrts or the vestries on the sabbath cve is for
acknowledgment, that is, that they should not think that it is
lawful to carry any thing from place to place on the sabbath ;
so this food is for acknowlcdgment and reulembrance, that
