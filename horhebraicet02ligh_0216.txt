yet that space is called by him “three days and three nights‚''
when as two nights only came between, and only one complete
day. Nevertheless, while he speaks these words, he is not
without the consent both of the J ewish schools, and their
computation. Weigh well that which is disputed in the tract
Schabbatho, concerning the uncleanness of a woman for three
days3 where many things are discussed by the Gemarists
concerning the computation of this space of three dayS.
Among other things these words occur; “ R. Ismael saith,
mm> ἸἻ ἶΠἮ &71:252 Sometimesp it contains fom- D'ffly Onotle,
sometimes five, sometimes six. But q how much is the space
of rmy cm Ouala, ,9 R. J ochanan saith either a day or a night.”
And so also the Jerusalem Talmud3 ‘⁶ R. Akibar fixed a day
for an Ouala, and a night for an Onah .· but the tradition is,
that R. Eliezar Ben Azariah said, ΠΞΡὩἸ mn? ³³7³& m*

ItS is not easy to translate the word {7:537 Ouala into good
Latin ; sor to some it is the sanie with the half of a natural
day; to some it is all one with νυχθήμερον, α whole natural
day. According to the first sense we may observe‚ from the
words of R. Ismael, that sometimes four mm> Onoth, or
halves of a natural day, may be accounted sor three days:
and that they also are so numbered that one part or the
other of those halves may b'e accounted for a whole. Gom-
pare the latter sense with the words of our Saviour‚ which
are now before us : “ Α day and a night (saith the tradition)
make an Ouala, and a part of an Ouala is as the whole.’'
Therefore Clu-ist may truly be said to have been in his grave
three Onoth, or τρὶς νυχθήμερον, three natural days (when yet
the greatest part of the first day was wanting, and the night
altogether, and the greatest part by far of the third day also),
the consent of the schools and dialect of the nation agreeing
thereunto. For, “the least part of the Onalo concluded the
whole.'' So that according to this idiom, that diminutive
