parallel end; but because other ends were added over and
above to this or that, or some ends were withdrawn.

II. The bapt-ism of proselytes was the bringing over of
Gentiles into the J ewish religion3 the baptism of John was.
the bringing over of Jews into another religion. And hence
it is the more to be wondered at, that the people so readily
flocked to him, when he introduced a baptism so different
from the known proselytical baptism. The reason of which
is to be fetched from hence‚—that at the coming of the
Messias they thought, not without cause, that the state of
things was plainly to be changed 3 and that, from the oracles
of the prophets, who, with one mouth, described the times of
the Messias for a new world. Hence was that received opin-
ion, zwnbw wau-1³& rr: ''pr-v vnvm num 51³⁷& Thac
God, at that time, would renem the world for a thousand
years. See the Aruch‚ in the word §773² and after in chap,
xxiv. 3. And that also, that they used &En-l 0³75? the world
to come, by a form of speech very common among them, for
the times of the Messias3 which we observe more largely
elsewhere.

ΙΙΙ. The baptism of proselytes was an obligation to per-
form the law; that of John was an obligation to repentanoe.
For although proselytical baptism admitted of some ends,—
and circumcisionu of others,—yet a traditional and erroneous
doctrine at that time had joined this to both, that the pros-
elyte covenanted in both, and obliged himself to perform the
law 5 to which that of the apostle relates, Gal. v. 3, “ I testifyx
again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor
to do the whole laW.”

But the baptism of John was a ‘baptism of repentance 3'
Mark i. 4: which being undertaken, they who were baptized
professed to renounce their own legal righteousness ; and, on
the contrary, acknowledged themselves to be obliged to re-
pentance and faith in the Messias to come. How much the
Pharisaical doctrine of justification differed from the evan-
gelicaL so much the obligation undertaken in the baptism of
proselytes differed from the obligation undertaken in the bap-
tism of John: which obligation also holds amongst Christians
to the end of the world.
