188 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. X. 34.

not that I am come to send peace, Sta] Although these words
may be understood truly of the differencesi between believers
and unbelievers by reason of the gospel, which all inter-
preters observe3 yet they do properly and primarily point
out, as it were with the finger, those horrid slaughtersk and
civil wars of the Jews among themselves, such as no other
age ever saw, nor story heard.

‘⁵ R. Eliezer¹ saith, The days of the Messias are forty years,
as it is said, ⁶ F orty years was Ι provoked by this generation.'''
And agaim “- R. J udah m saith, In that generation, when the
Son of David shall come, the schools shall be harlots; Galilee
shall be laid waste; Gablan shall be destroyed ς and the in-
habitants of the earth [the Gloss is ⁶ the Sanhedrim'] shall
wandel· from city to city, and shall not obtain pity3 the
wisdom of the scribes shall stink3 and they that fear to sin
shall be despised3 and the faces of that generation shallbe
like⁴ the faces of dogs3 and truth shall fail, &c Run over
the history of these forty years, from the death of Christ to
the destruction of Jerusalem (as they are vulgarly computed),
and you will wonder to observe the nat-ion conspiring to its
own destruction, and rejoicing in the slaughters and spoils of
one another beyond all example, and even to a miracle. This
phrensy certainly was sent upon then] from heaven. And
first, they are deservedly become mad who trod the wisdom
of God, as much as they could, under their feet. And se-
condly‚ the blood of the prophets and of Christ, bringing the
good tidings of peace, could not be expiated by a less venge-
ance. Tell me, Ο Jew, whence is that rage of your nation
towards the destruction of one another, and those monsters
of madness beyond all examples? Does the nation rave for
nothing, unt-0 their own ruin? Acknowledge the Divine venge-
ance in thy madness, more than that which befell thee from
men. He that reckons up the differences, contentions, and
broils of the nation, after the dissension betwixt the Pharisees
and the Sadducees, will meet with no less between the scho-
lars of Shammai and Hillel, which increased to that degree,
that at last it came to slaughter and blood.
