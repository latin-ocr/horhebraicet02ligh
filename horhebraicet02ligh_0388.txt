III. An infant is capable of privileges, as well as an old
man ; and baptism is privilegial. An infant hath been crowned
king in his cradle: an infant may be made free who is born a
slave. The Gemaristsk speak very well in this matter; “ Rabh
Houna saith, They baptize an infant proselyte by the com-
mand of the bench. &unp *Nm Upon what is this yromzded?

sent person with α privileyes or they may bestow a privilege
upon one, though he be ignorant of it. Tell me then, why an
infant is not capable of being brought into the visible church,
and of receiving the distinguishing sign between a Christian
and a heathen, as well as a grown person.

IV. One may add, that an infant is part of his parent:
upon this account, Gen. xvii. 14, an infant is to be cut off if
he be not circumcised, when, indeed, the fault is his parents'3

by the cutting off of their child. And hence is that of Exod.
xx. 5, “Visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children,”
because children are a part of their fathers, &a From hence
ariseth also a natural reason of infant-baptism : the infants of
baptized parents are to be baptized, because they are part
of them, and that the whole parents may be baptizedl. And
upon this account they used of old, with good reason, to bap-
tize the whole family, with the master of it.

I. Christ commands them to go and baptize the nations ; but
how much time was past before such a journey was taken!
And when the time was now corne that this work should be
begun, Peter doth not enter upon it without a previous ad-
monition given him from heaven. And this was occasioned
hereby, that, according to the command of Christ, the gospel
was first to be p’reached to J uclea, Samaria, and Galilee.

II. He commands them to baptize in the name ⁰f the
Fatlcer, and qf the Son, and qf the Holy lest: but among
the Jews they bapt-ized only in the omme of Jesus ‚· which we
have observed before, from Acts ii. 38 3 viii.16; xix. 5. For this
reason, that thus the baptizers might assert, and the baptized
