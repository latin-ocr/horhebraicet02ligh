openly lamented him] “ might help to atone for him; but
they som-owed for him in their hearts3 for this did not tend
to his honour, nor lessen the atonement.'' Those were

better instmcted, who lamented for Christ both as to the
thing and person.

Ver. 33: Γολγοθά· Golqotlza] Beza pretends that this is
written amiss for Golgoltlca, Γολγολθά, when yet it is found
thus written in all copies. But the good man censures amiss3
since such a leaving out of letters in many Syriae words
is very usual: you have this word thus written without the
second λ, by the Samaritan interpreter, in the first chapter of
Numbers.

Ver. 34³1: ’Έδωκαν αὐτῷ πιεῖν ὅξος μετὰ χολῆς μεμιγμένον·
They gyrwe him vineyar to dm'nk minyled with galb] “To
thosey that were to be executed they gave a grain of myrrh
infused in wine to drink, that their understanding might be
disturbed,” (that is, that they might lose their senses); ‘⁶ as
it is said, ‘ Give strong drink to them thatare ready to die,
and wine to those that are of a sorrowful heart,' &o. And
the tradition is, That some women of quality in Jerusalem
allowed this freely of their own cost‚” 850.

But it makes a scruple that in Matthew it- is ὅξος μετὰ
χολῆς, vine-(yar with 9aZl; in Mark, ἐσμυρνισμένον οἶνον, wine
mz'ozyled with myrrh. If wine, why is it called vineyar? If
wine mingled with myrrh, why grall? Ans. The words of
Mark seem to relate to the custom of the nation3 those of
Matthew, to the thing as it was really acted. I understand
Mark thus, They gave him, according to the custom of the
nation‚ that cup which used to be given to those that were
led to execution 3 but (as Matthew has it) not the usual mix-
ture3 namely, wine and fraukincenae, or myrrh 3 but for the
greater mockery, and out of more bitter rancour, vineqar and
yall. So that we may suppose this cup not to have been
prepared by those honourable women, compassionating those
that were to die, but on purpose by the scribes, and the
other persecutors of Christ, studying to heap upon him all
kind of ignominy and vexation. In this cup they afterward
dipped a sponge, as may be supposed: see the 48th verse.
