Ch. xxvi. 3.] Exercitations upon Sl. Matthew. 327

Notwithstanding it was not so lost, but that sometimes
they exereised it; namely, when they observed they might
do it safely and without danger. “ Dat veniam eorvis,’' 810.
spares ermes, but vex-eth pifyeons. Thieves, murderers‚ and
wicked men armed with force, they dared not eall into their
judgment; they were afraid of so desperate a erew: but to
judge, condemn, torture, and put to death poor men and
Christians, from whom they feared no such danger, they
dreaded it not, they did not avoid it. They had been ready
enough at condemning our Saviour himself to death if they
had not feared the people‚ and if Providence had not other-
wise determined of his death.

We may also, by the way, add that also which follows
after the place above cited, '⁹1⁸7 ἾῙἬΔὉ *rw 12 ῙἾΡὩΨ ἺΞἾΞ
ἓξὲἾῐζῗἻὩ ΠἹΞἸῺῺ Inx the clay of Simeon Ben Joclmi, juclyments
of peczcniary matters were taken away from Israel. ln y the
same tract this is said to have been in ‘⁶ the days of Simeon
Ben b'hetah‚” long before Christ was born: but this is an
error of the transcribers.

But now, if the J ewish eouneil lost their power of judging
in pecuniary causes by the same means as they lost it in ea-
pital, it must needs be that deceits, oppressions‚ and mutual
injuries were grown so common and daring that they were let
alone, as being above all punishment. The Babylonian Ge-
marists allege another reason 3 but whether it be only in
favour os their nation, this is, no fit place to examinez.

That we may yet further confirm our opinion, that the
authority of that eouneil in eapital matters was not taken
away by the Romans, we will produeea two stol-ies, as clear
examples of the thing we assert : one is thisb ; ‘⁶ R. Lazar
son of R. Zadok said, ⁶ When I was a little boy, sitting on
my father's shoulders, Ι saw a priest’s daughter that had
played the hai-lot eompassed round with fagots and burnt.'”
The couneil no doubt judging and condemning her, and this
after J udea had then groaned many years under the Roman
yoke3 for that same R. Lazar saw the destruction of the city. ’

The other you have in the same tract ⁰, where they are
