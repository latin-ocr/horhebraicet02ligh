of no ordinary worth, and the like to whom their times produced
not many. One was the very famous George Downham, S. T. D.,
presented by king J ames, who was promoted hence, and sent over
to the bishopric of Derry in Ireland. And he leaving it, that ex-
cellent person Samuel lVard, S. T. D„ master of Sidney Sussex Col-
lege, in the university of Cambridge, and also the most grave and
learned professor of the lady Margaret in the same university,
was made his successor by king Charles. Upon his decease I suc-

then, while the wars prevailed, possessed all. The brit-tleness of
this my weak title lay not concealed ; but when the king's majesty,
in which we now rejoice‚ by a happy turn of Providence returned

despair is to subscribe to one's own missortune, is to derogate
from the king's mercy, is to submit to certain ruin under uncertain
suspicion. Perhaps the most merciful king is not angry with me
at all, for eagles do not use to be angry with flies. Nor, per-

unknown to the best king, or disguised by some unjust complaint 3
and it is a comfort that my business lies before a kinffi not before a

To the altar, therefore, of his mercy I humbly fly in a lowly sup-
plication, begging and entreating him to consider my case, to revoke
the destructive decree, and to vouchsafe to continue and establish
my station in this place. Take nowb, Ο England‚ a measure of
