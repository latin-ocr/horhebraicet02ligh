ἄτας the Holy Blessed One, his, &c.” This phrase occurs
five times in that one column: ‘⁶ thef Holy Blessed God doth
not g, as flesla and blood doth, &a Flesk and· blood wound
with one thing and heal with another: but the Holy
Bl‘essed One wounds and heals with one and the same thing.
Joseph was sold for his dreams, and he was promoted by

Ver. 18: Σὺ εἳ Πέτρος, διο. Thou art Peter, δῖα] Ι. There
is nothing, either in the dialect of the nation, or in reason,
forbids us to think that our Saviour used this very same
Greek word, since such Graecizings were not unusual in that
nation. But be it granted (which is asserted more without
controversy) that he used the Syriae word3 yet I deny that
