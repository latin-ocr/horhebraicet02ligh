that the best and the most modest of that order came to
his baptism: the best of the Pharisees certainly were the
worst of men. And it is so much the more to be wondered
at that these men should receive his baptism after that man-
ner as they did3 when it was highly contrary to the rule
of the Pharisees to converse among the common people, of
whom there was so great a concourse to J0hn3 and highly
