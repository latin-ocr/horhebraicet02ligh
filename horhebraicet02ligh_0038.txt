forty years (as it is commonly deputed) coming between >the
death of Christ and the destruction of the city, there remain a
the twenty-seven years of Hillel before the birth of our Sa-
viour. ,

Η11161 held the government forty years: so that his death
happened about the twelfth or thirteenth year of Christ. His
son also held it after him, and his grandsons, in a long suc-
cession, even to R. J udah the Holy. The splendour and pomp
of this family of Hillel had so obscured the rest of the families
of David's stock‚ that perhaps they believed or expected the
less, that the Messias should spring from any of them. Yea,
one in the Babylonian Gemara was almost persuaded, that
“ Rabbi Judah the Holy, of the Hillelian family, was the
Messias. Rabhb said, ’ΖῙἹἺΡΠ 'lnam 3¹²2: N'W’l *5¹0 Ἣ If
Messialz be among] the Zivz'ny, om· Holy Babba· is such: is among
the dead, Daniel was he.''

V. Christ was born in the month of Tisri3 somewhat an-
swering to our September. This we conclude, omitting other
thingS‚ by computing backwards from his death. For if he
died in his two-and-thirtieth year and a half, at the feast of
the Passover‚ in the month Nisan, you must necessarily lay
the time of his birth 111 1116 111011111 Tisri. But that he died at
that age, not to make any delay by mentioning more things,
appears hence, that he was baptized now beginning his thir-
tieth year, and that he lived after his baptism three years
and a half 3 as the space of his public ministry is determined
by the angel Gabriel, Dan. ix. [27]; “ In the half of a
week” (that is, three years and a half), “he shall make the
sacrifice to cease,⁷' 816. But of this hereafter.

This mouth was ennobled in former times, 1. For the crea-
tion of the world. Weigh well Exod. xxiii. 15, Joel ii. 23.
2. For the nat-ivity of the first fathers3 which the J ews0 assert
not without reason. 3. For the repairing the tables of the
laW. For Moses, after the third fast of forty days, comes
down from the mountain, a messenger of good things, the
tenth day of this mouth, which was from hence appointed
for the feast of Expiation to following ages 4. For the
dedication of the Temple, 1 Kings viii. 2. And, 5. For three
