a full and complete history was not composed but of all joined
and compared together.

Ι wish the reverend Beza had sufficiently considered this,
who rendereth πέραν Ἰορδάνου, not beyond, but by Jordan,
and corrects the Vulgar interpreter and Erasmus, who render
it ‘ beyond Jordan‚’ properly and most truly: “As if, by
Perea (saith he), or the country beyond Jordan, Christ,
passing over Jordan or the lake of Tiberias, came into J udea
out of Galilee3 which is not true.⁷' But take heed you do
not mistake, reverend old man. For he went over Jordan
from Capernaum, as it is very probable, by the bridge built
over Jordan between Chammath, near to Tiberias, at the
Gadarene country: he betook himself to Bethabara, and
stayed some time there, John x. 40: thence he went along
Perea to the bank over against J ericho. While he tarrieth
there, a messenger, sent from Mal-y, comes to him concerning
the death of Lazarus, John xi3 and thence, after two days, he
passeth Jordan in J udea.

Ver. 17: Γονυπετήσας αὐτόν· Knoeled to kim] So chap. i. 40,
Παρακαλῶυ αὐτὸν, καὶ γονυπετῶν αὐτόν· Beseechinq him, and
kneelinq to Izi-m«. This is variously rendered, procidit ad pedes,
yenu flexo, yenn petens, ad yenua procidens, &c. He fell 'at
his feet, bowiny the knee, beseeckiny upon his knee, falling]
down at his knees. Which renderings are not improper‚ but
I suspect something more is included. For, 1. It was
customary for those that so adored to take hold of the
knees οι· the legs, 2 Kings iv. 27; Matt. xxviii. 9. 2. Το
kiss the knees or the feet, See what we have said at
Matt. xxviii. 9.

When R. Akibam had been twelve years absent from his
wife, and at last came back, his wife went out to meet him:
“and when she came to him, falling upon her face, &p

when he was entered into the city, his father-in-law not know-
ing who ho was, but suspecting him to be some great Rabbin,
went to him, and falling upon his face U'QV'Db ³³³7 rnpwz
