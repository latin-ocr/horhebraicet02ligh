II. Hence, not without ground, it is concluded tha-t that
nation was rejected and given over to a reprobate sense,
even before the coming of Christ. They were not only γενεὰ,
α yeneration, but γεννήματα, an ‹ffipriny of vipers, serpents
sprung from sei-pents. Nor is it wonder that they were re-
jected by God, when they had long since rejected God, and
God's word, by their traditions. See that Matt. xiii. 13—15,

There was, indeed, a certain remanant among them to be
gathered by Christ: and when that was gathemd, the rest

time is to overflow the J ewish nation. Think here, if those
that came to baptism brought not their little ones with them
to baptism: when, by the plain words os the Baptist, those
that are baptized are said to “ fly from the wrath to come 3'’
that is, ‘ the wrath of efod} that was not long hence to destroy
the nation by a most sad overthrow.
