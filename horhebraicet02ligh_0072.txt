that came to him in his name, instructing them in the doc-
trine of the gospel, concerning saith in the Messias, and
repentance3 that they might be the readier to receive the
Messias when he should manifest himself. Consider well
Mal. iii. 1, LukeZ i. 17, John i. 7, 31, &c. The apostles,
baptizing the Jews, baptized them “in the name of Jesus;”
because Jesus of Nazareth had now been revealed for the
Messias; and that they did, when it had been before com-
manded them by Christ, ‘⁶ Baptize all nations in the name of
the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'' So you ψ
must understand that which is spoken, John iii. 23, iv. 2, con-
cerning the disciples of Christ baptizing3 namely, thata they
baptized in ‘the name of J esim,⁹ that thence it might be
known that J esus of Nazareth was the Messias, in the name
rof whom, suddenly to come, John had baptized. That of St.
Peter is plain, Acts ii. 38 3 ‘⁶ Be baptized, every one of γοα,
:in the name of J esus Ohrist:'' and that, Acts viii. 16, “They
were baptized in the name of JeSUS.”

But the apostles baptized the Gentiles, according to the
precept of our Lord, “ In the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost,'’ Matt. xxviii. 19. For since
it was very much controverted among the Jews about the
true Messias, and that unbelieving nation denied, stiffiy and
without ceasing, that J esus of Nazareth was he (under which
virulent spirit they labour even to this day), it was not without
cause, yea, nor without necessit-y, that they baptized in the
name of Jesus3 that by that seal might be confirmed this
most principal truth in the gospel, and that those that were
baptized might profess it, that J esus of Nazareth was the
true Messias. But among the Gentiles, the controversy was
not concerning the true Messias, but concerning the true
God: among them, therefore, it was needful that baptism
should be conferred in the name of the true God, “ Father,
Son, and Holy Spi1=it.''

We. suppose, therefore, that men, women, and children
came to John’s baptism, according to the manner of the
nation in the reception of proselytes3 namely, that they
standing in Jordan were taught by John that they were
