Ι. Very many among them were sprung, indeed, of the
seed of Jacob, though now become renegades and apostates
from the J ewish saith and nation, and hating them more than
if they were heathens, and more than they would do heathens.
Which also, among other things, may perhaps be observed in
their very language. For read the Samaritan version of the
Pentateuch3 and, if I mistake not, you will observe that the
Samaritans, when, by reason of the nearness of the places,
and the alliance of the nations, they could not but make
use of the language of the Jews, yet used such a variation
and change of the dialect, as if they scorned to speak the
same words that they did, and make the same language not
the Same.

II. In like manner they received the Mosaic laW‚ but, for
the most part, in so different a writing of the words, that
they seem plainly to have propounded this to themselves,
that retaining indeed the law of Moses, they would hold it
under as much difference from the Mosaic text of the Jews
as ever they could, so that they kept something to the sense.-
“ R. EliezerC Ben R. Simeon said, ‘ I said to the scribes of the

profit accruing to you thereby. For ye have written in your law,

is Sychem? '³ Sco. (the word 0:12.) is added.) Let the Samaritan
text at Deut. xi. 30 be looked upon.

III. However they pretended to study the religion of
Moses, yet, in truth, there was little or no difference be-
tween them and idolaters, when they knew not what they

’ worshipped; which our Saviour objects against them, John

iv. 22 : and had not only revolted as apostates from the true
religion of Moses, but set themselves against it with the great-
est hatred. Hence the Jewish nation held them for heathens,
or for a people more execrable than the heathens themselves.
A certain Rabbin thus reproaches their idolatry: “ RISmaeld
Ben R. J osi went to Neapolis [that is, Sychem] ; the Sama-
ritans came to him, to whom he spake thus ; ‘ I see that you
adore not this mountain, but the idols which are under it:
