Ch. v. 18.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 103

The Jerusalem Talmud treats of this matter in these
words: “ R. Jochanan de Beth Gubrin saithc, There are
four noble tongues which the world useth: the mother-
tongue, for singing3 the Roman, for war3 the Syriae, for
mourning3 the Hebrew, for elocution: and there are some
which add the Assyriam, for writing. The Assyrian hath
writing [that is, letters or characters]‚ but a language it hath
not. The Hebrew hath a language, but writing it hath not.
They chose to themselves the Hebrew language in the Assy-
rian character. But why is it called *²55th the Assyrian?
um: ’ἾΨἾΝὩ bns-W] Because it is blessed (or direct) in its
writz'ny. R. Levi saith, Because it came up into their hands
out of Assyria.’⁷

“ A. tradition. R. J osi saith, Ezra was fit, by whose hands
the law might have been given, but that the age of Moses
prevented. But although the law was not given by his hand,
yet writing [that is, the forms of the letters] and the language
were given by his hand. ⁶ And the writing of the epistle was
writ in Syriae, and rendered in Syriac‚' Ezra iv. 7. ‘ And
they could not read the writing,’ Dan. v. 8. From whence is
shown that the writing [that is, the form of the characters
and letters] was given that very same day. R. Nathan saith ε
The law was given in breakingd [that is, in letters more rude
and more disjoined]: and the matter is as R. Josi saith.
Rabbi [Judah Haccodesh] saith, The law was given in the
Assyrian languageg and when they sinned it was turned into
breaking. And when they were worthy in the days of Ezra,
it was turned for them again into the Assyrian. Ι show
to-day, that I will render to you 'mlum Mislmek, tlte doublecl,
or, as if he should say tlte seoondede (Zech. ix. 12). And he
shall write for himself the Mishnek (the doubled) of this law
in a book (Deut. xvii. 18), namely‚ in a writing that was to
be changed. R. Simeon Ben Eleazar saith, in the name
of R. Eleazar Ben Parta, and he in the name of R. Lazar
the Hammodean, The law was given in Assyrian writing.

Whence is that proved? from those words, &fixam-231 Ἢ
