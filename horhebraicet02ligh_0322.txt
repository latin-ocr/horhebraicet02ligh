“ Letg not any one go abroasl with his amulet on the sab-
bath day, unless that amulet be prescribed by an approved
physieian” (or, “ unless it be an approved amulet 3⁹³ see the
Gemara). Now these amulets were either little roots hung
about the neeks of siek persons, or, what was more common,
bits of paper with words written on them (ΞΠ) ³712> 37³0? 01·

either driven away or enred: which they wore all the Week,
but vvere forbid to wear on the sabbath, unless with a caution:
“Theyh do not say a eharm over a wound on the sabbath,
that also which is said over a mandi-ake is forbid” on the
sabbath. “ If any one say, Come and say this versicle over
my son, or lay the 130011Ἡ of the law “ upon him, to make

of many things, which they used to carry about with them,
as romedies against certain ailments; and of mutterings over
wounds: and there you may see, that while they avoidk the
enchantments of the Amorites, they have and allow their
own. You have, Bab. ιῙονηα, fol. 84. 1, the form of an en-
chantment against a mad dog. And, Acoclah, ΖαναῘι, fol. 12.

You have, Hieros. schah. fol. 1 3. 4, and Avod. ΖαναῘι, fol. 40.
4, mut-terings and enchantments, even in the name of ‚J esus.
See also the Babyl. Sanheclr. fol.101.1‚ concerning these kind
of mutterings.
