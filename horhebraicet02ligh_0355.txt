Oh. xxvi. 26.] Exercitations upon St. Alattlzew. 349

Maimonides in the place quoted, as also the Tahnudists in
several places in the last chapter in the tract Pesaclcz'n.

And now was the time when Christ, taking bread, insti-
tuted the eucharist: but whether was it after the eating of
those farewell morsels, as Ι may call them, of the lamb, or
instead of them? It seems 10 be in their stead, because it
is said by our evangelist and Mark, Ἐσθιόντων αὐτῶν, &c
As they were eatiny, Jesus took breed. Now, without doubt,
they speak according to the known and common custom of
that supper, that they might be understood by their own peo-
ple. But all Jews know well enough, that after the eating of
those morsels of the lamb it cannot be said, As they were
eati729,· for the eating was endedk with those morsels. It
seems therefore more likely that Christ, when they were now
ready to take those morsels, changed the custom, and gave
about morsels of bread in their stead, and instituted the sa-
crament. Some are of opinion, that it was the cust-om to taste
the unleavened bread last of all, and to close up the supper
with it; of which opinion, I confess, I also sometimes was.

cause there is such a thing mentioned in some of the rubrics
about the passover; and with good reason, because they took
up this custom after the destruction of the Temple.

the paschal bread. One of the two loaves was first divided
into two parts, or, perhaps, into more, before it was blessed.
ῙΠΌ ἾΠδὶ ἶῖἶῖἹΠ One qs them is divided.- they are the words
of Maimonides‚ who also adds, “But why doth he not bless
both the loaves after the same manner as in other feasts3
Because this is called ”2739 :mlv the bread of poverty. Now
poor people deal in morsels, and here likewise are morsels.”

applied to the Passover now newly caten, will be more clear:
