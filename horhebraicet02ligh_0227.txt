the morsel is, as it were, an appendix to it. ΠἾῙῬῺ Tlee salt
meat, saith he, is to be understood of fish, as the tradition
teacheth, that he that vows abstinence fron] salt things is
restrained from nothing but from salt fish.” VVhether these
were saltfisk, it were a ridiculous matter to attempt to deter-
mine3 but if they were, the manner of blessing which Christ
used is worthy to be compared with that which the tradition
now alleged commands.

Ver. 20: Καὶ ἔφαγον πάντες, καὶ ἐχορτάσθησαν· And they did
all eat, and were filled] So U'YWD eatingy, or α repast after
food, is defined by the Tahnudists3 namely, “ When they eat
their fin. Rabhh saith, rm& rem m. ζήτω rtrum ¹7:
177sz All eatiny, where salt is ποτ, is not eatiwyss’ The Aruch
citing these words, for {7370 salt, reads ΠἾίῗῃ somethiozy sea-
soned, and adds, “ It is no eating, because they are not filled.''

Ver. 22: Καὶ εὐθέως ἠυάγκασε τοὺς μαθητὰς, 830. Anici im-
mediately he compelled lais diseiples, eye] The reason of this
compulsori is given by St. J ohni, namely‚ because the people
seeing the miracle were ambitious to make him a king : per-
haps that the disciples might not conspire to do the same,
who as yet dreamed too much of the temporal and earthly
kingdom of the Messias.

Ver. 2 3 : Ὀψίας δὲ γενομένης· lVlzen the evem'ny zoas come]
So ver. 15, but in another sense: for that denotes the late-
ness of the day; this, the lateness of the night. So 2537
eveniny, in the Talmudists, signifies not only the declining
part of the day, but the night also: ‘⁶ fromk what time do
they recite the phylacteries ΠἿΞἾῺΞ, in tlte eveninsy? From
the time when the priests go in to eat their Truma, even
to the end of the first watch, as R. Eliezer saith ; but, as the
wise men say, unto midnight 3 yea, as Rabban Gamaliel
saith, even to the rising of the pillar of the n101·ning.” Where
the Gloss is, {7375172 ΠἮἾὩΞ in the eveniozq, that is, in the
m'ylzt.

Ver. 25: Τετάρτῃ δὲ φυλακῇ τῆς νυκτός· In the fourth walch,
of the migma] That is, after cock crowing : the Jews acknow-
ledge only three watches of the night, for this with them was
the third; ³³74> ἴτω ΝΠ 12>sz mmm& The match is me
