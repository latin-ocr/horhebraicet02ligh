στοὰ βασιλικὴ, the kin-9²3 yallery, that deserves to be mentioned
among the most magnificent things under the sun: for upon
a huge depth of a valley‚ scarcely to be fathomed by the eye
of him that stands above, Herod erected a gallery of a vast
height3 from the top of which if any looked down, σκοτο«

Sltowed him all the kinydoms of tlte world, ἅμα] That is,
Rome with her empire and state. For, 1. That empire is
called πᾶσα οἰκουμένη, all the world, (which word Luke [iv. 5.]
useth in this story‚) both in sacred and profane writers.
2. At this time all cities were of little account in compa-
rison of Rome, nor did any part of the earth bear any vogue
without that empire. 3. Rome was ‘the seat of Satan,'
Rev. xiii. 2; and he granted to the beast of that city both
it and the dominion. 4. This therefore seems to be that
whereby he attempts to ensnare our Saviour in this object,
namely, that he proniiseth to give him the pomp and power
of Oaesar, and to deliver into his hand the highest empire of
the world, that is, the Roman. This, antichrist afterward
obtained.

Ver. 13: Καὶ καταλιπών τὴν Ναζαρὲθ, ἐλθὼν κατῴκησεν εἷς
Καπερυαούμ· And, leavz'ny Nazareth, lie came αηαῖ dwelt at
Capermum] Why he left Nazareth after he had passed six
or seven-and-twenty years there, the reason appears, Luke
iv. 28, &c We do not read that he returned thither again ;
and so, unhappy Nazareth, thou perishest by thine own folly
and perverseness. WVhether his father J oseph had any in-
heritance at Capernaum, which he possessed as his heir, or
rather dwelt there in some hired house, we dispute not. This
is certainly called his city, Matt. ix, 1, ἅπας and here, as a
citizen, he paid the half· shekel‚ Matt. xvii 24. Where it is
worthy marking what 1s said by the Jews: 5³37: ΝΠἾ rm:
