that the letter Ἶ [Vau] in the law z‘s like a pillar.'⁷ So the J eru-
salem Talmudists.

Discourse is had of the same business in the Babylonian
Talmudf, and almost in the same words, these being added
over: “ The law was given to Israel in Hebrew writing, and
in the holy langnage. And it was given to them again in the
days of Ezra, in Assyrian writing, and the Syriae language.
The Israelites chose to themselves the Assyrian writing‚ and

the holy language; ῙἾΚΠῖἹἹ Nur nn: mter-trib ἾΠἾΞΠἸ

mmm& 237: :’' that is, according to the Gloss, ‘⁸ Grreat let-

doorposts.'’

That we may a little apprehend the meaning of the Rab-
bins, let it be observed,

I. That by ‘ the mother-tongue’ (the Hebrew, Syriae, Ro-
man, being named particularly) no other certainly can be
understood than the Greek, we have shown at the three-and-
twentieth verse of the first chapter.

II. That that writing which the Gemarists call ³5:37 ΞΠΣ
and which we have interpreted by a very known word, Heln-ew
wrz'tinffl——is not therefore called ³5:237, because this was proper
to the Israelites, or because it was the ancient writing‚ but

(as the Gloss very aptly) ’ἿΠΠΠ *³:137 ’ΣΞ ³712> *⁶5:27 :nn
because the writz'ny or character was in use among) them that

dwelt beyond Euphrates. In the same sense as some would

have Abraham called *129 Heln-ew, signifying on tlte other side,
that is, beyond or on the other sicle of Amana.

Many nations were united into one language, that is, the
old Syriae,——-nan1ely, the Chaldeans, the Mesopotamians, the
Assyrians, the Syrians. Of these some were the sons of Sem
and some of Ham. Though all had the same lemguage, it is
no wonder if all had not the same letters, The Assyrians and
Israelites refer their original to Sem3 these had the Assyrian
writing: the sons of Ham that inhabited beyond Euphrates
