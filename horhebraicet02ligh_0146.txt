“A erumpet (saith the Gloss) for excommunioation and ana-

thematizz'ny: and a sandal for the taking off of the shoe of
the husband's brother.” And in the same placed mention is

this proclamation did publish what was giving by every 0116,

rightly be given 3 let the more learned judge by looking upon
the place. ⁸

III. They gave alms also out of the field, and that- was
especially fourfold: 1. The corner of the field not reaped.
2. Sheaves left in the field, either by forgetfulness, or volun-
