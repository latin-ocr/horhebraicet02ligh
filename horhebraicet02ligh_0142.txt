136 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. vi. 1.

Old Testament, signifies nothing else than riyhteousness5 yet
now, when our Saviour spoke those words, it signified nothing
so much as alms.

II. Christ used also the same word &rip-13 rz‘ylcteousness
in the three verses next following, and Matthew used the
word ἐλεημοσύνη, alms: but by what right, I beseech you,
should he call it δικαιοσύνην, riqlateousness, in the first verse,
and ἐλεημοσύνην, alms, in the following,—when Christ every
where used one and the same word? Matthew might not
change in Greek, where our Saviour had not changed in
Syriae.

Therefore we must say, that the Lord J esus used the word
ΠΡἺΕ, or &Dp-13, in these four first verses: but that, speak-
ing in the dialect of common people‚ he was understood by
the common people to speak of alms.

Now they called alms by the name of ΠΡἻΞ νίίρᾶτθοαεηεεε, in
that the Fathers of the Traditions taught, and the common
people believed, that alms conferred very much to y‘ustz‘ficatiooz.
Hear the J ewish chair in this matter:

‘⁶ Forl one farthing, given to a poor man in alms, a man is
made partakei of the beatifical vision. ³³ Where it renders
these words 7³:³³3 ΠῗΠζξῗ {7732} ³:232 [Ps. xvii. 15] I shall be-
hold thy face 1n riqkteousnessss after this manner-3 ‘I shall be-
hold thy face because of alr ns.³

One saith, “ Thism money goes for alms, that my sons may
live, and that I may obtain the world to come.’'

“ An man's table now expiates by (dms, as heretofore t-he
altar did by sacrifice.³³

“ Ifo you afford alms out of your purse, God will keep you
from all damage and harm.³³

“ Monobazesp the king bestowed his goods liberally upon
the poor, and had these words spoke to him by his kinsmen
and friends, ‘ Your ancestors increased both their own riches
and those that were left them by their fathers3 but you waste
both your own and those of your ancestors.’ To whom he
answered, ‘ My fathers laid up their wealth on earth; I lay up
mine in heaven; as it is written, Truth shall flourislo out qs
