148 Hebrew and Tahnuclioal [Oh. vi. 9.

1. To compose forms of short prayers, and to deliver them
to their scholars (which is asserted also of John, Luke xi. 1);
whereof you will find some examples ⁰, and they not a few,
in the Babyloniam Gemara, in the tract Beracoth, and else·
where. Not that by those forms they banished or destroyed
the set and aceustomed prayers of the nation; but they super—
