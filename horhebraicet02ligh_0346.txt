bable, to Bethany3 and is supposed by the disciples, who
were ignorant of the matter, to have performed his office
exceeding diligently, in providing necessaries for the ap-
proaching feast. On the day itself of the Passover‚ Jesus
removes from Bethany with his disciples: “Arise (saith he),
let us go hence,'' John xiv. 31, and comes to Jerusalem.

Ver. 7 : Κατέχεευ ἐπὶ τὴν κεφαλὴν αὐτοῦ ἀνακειμένου· Poured
it upon his head, as ke sat at meaa] Therefore, it was not the
same supper with that in John xii. 1 ς for then our Saviour's
feet were anointed‚ now his head. I admire that any one
should be able to confound these two stories. Oil, perfumed
with spice-3, was very usual in feasts, especially sacred; and it
was wont to be poured upon the head of some one present.

“They school of Shammai saith, He holds sweet oil in his
right hand, and a cup of wine in his left. He says grace
first over the oil, and then over the wine. The school of
*Hillel saith, Oil in his right hand, and wine in his left. He
blesseth the sweet oil, and anoints the head of him that
serves: but if the waiter be a disciple of the wise, he anoints
the wall; for it is a shamez for a disciple of the wise to smell
of persumes.” Here the waiter anoints the head of him that
sits down.

Ver. 8: Εἰς τί ἡ ἀπώλεια αὕτης To what purpose is this
waste .9] It was not without cause that it was called “ pre-
cious ointment‚'’ ver. 7, and “very costly,” John xii. 3: to
shew that it was not of those common sorts of ointments
used in feasts, which they thought it no waste to pour upon
the waiter’s head, or to daub upon the wall. But this oint-
ment was of much more value‚ and thence arose the cavil.

Ver. 9³: Καὶ δοθῆναι τοῖς πτωχοῖς· And be yiven to the poor]
That it was J udas especially who cavilled at this, we have
reason to believe from what is said of him in another supper,
John xii. 4. Compare this with those words, John xiii. 29.
When J esus said to J udas, “What thou doest, do quickly‚'’
some thought he had meant, ‘⁶ Give something to the poor.”
That supper, I presume, was the same with this: and see,
how these things agree! When a complaint arose of that pro-
digal waste of the ointment here, and before in John xii, and
