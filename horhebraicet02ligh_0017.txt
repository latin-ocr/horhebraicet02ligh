’ Ch. i. 8,] Exercitations upon St. Mattheus. 11

Jewish writers agree with MattheW, that they confess Ra-
chab was married to some prince of Israel, but mistaking
concerning the person: whether they do this out of igno-
rance, or wilfully, let themselves look to that. Concerning
this matter, the Babyloniam Gremarao hath these words:
‘⁶ Eight prophets and those priests sprung from Rachab, and
they are these, Neriah, Baruch, Seraiah, Maaseiah, Jeremiah,
Hilkiah, Hanameel, and Shallum. R. Judah saith, Huldah
also was of the posterity of Racliab.” And a little after,
“ There is a tradition, that she, being made a proselytess,
was married to J oshua :'' which Kimchi also produceth in
Josh. vi. Here the Gloss casts in a scruple: ‘⁶ lt sounds
somewhat harshly (saith it), that ‚Joshua married one that
was made a pmselyte, when it was not lawful to contract
marriage with the Canaanites‚ though they became proselyteS.
Theresore we must say that she was not of the seven nations of
the Ganaanites, but- of some other nation, and sojourned there.
But others say that that prohibition took not place before the
entrance into the promised land,⁷’ &c.

Ver. 8: Ἰωρὰμ δὲ ἐγέννησε τὸν Ὀζίαυ· And Joram beqat
Ozias] The names os Ahazias‚ J oash, and Amazias, are
struck out. See the history in the books of the Kings, and
1 Ghron. iii. 11, 12.

I. The promise that “the throne of David should not be
empty,'' passed over, after a manner, for some time into the
family os J ehu, the overthrower of J oram's family. For when
he had razed the house of Ahab, and had slain AhaziahP,
sprung, on the mother's side, of the family of Ahab, the Lord
promiseth him that his sons should reign unto the fourth
generation, 2 Kings x. 30. Therefore however the mean
time the throne of David was not empty, and that J oash and
Amazias sat during the space between, yet their names are
not unfitly omitted by our evangelist, both because they were
sometimes not very unlike Joram in their manners; and
because their kingdom was very much eclipsed by the
kingdom of lsrael, when Ahazias was slain by Jehu, and
his cousin Amazias taken and basely subdued by his cousin
Joash, 2 Chron. xxv. 23.
