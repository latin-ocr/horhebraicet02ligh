plagues foretold by the Rabbins to befall this or that man?
which came to pass just according as they were foretold. I
rather suspect some magic art in most of these, than fiction
in all.

IV. False Ohrists broke out, and appeared in public with
their witchcrafts‚ so much the frequenter and more impu-
dent, as the city and people drew nearer to its ruin; be-
cause the people believed the Messias should be manifested
before the destruction of the city; and each of them pre-
tended to be the Messias by these signs. From the words
of Isaiahu, “Before her pain carne, she was delivered of a
man child,’' the doctors comluded, “ that the Messias should
be manifested before the destruction of the city.’' Thus
the Chaldee paraphrast upon the place3 “ She shall be
saved before her utmost extremity, and her king shall be
revealed before her pains of childbirth.'' Mark that also;
“Thex Son of David will not come, till the wicked empire
[of tlte Romans] shall have spread itself over all the world
nine months; as it is said Y, ‘ Therefore will he give them
up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought
forth? '² ⁶

To discover clearly the sense of this and the following clauses,
those two things must be observed which we have formerly
given notice of :—

1. That the destruction of Jerusalem is very frequently ex-
pressed in Scripture as if it were the destruction of the whole
world, Deut. xxxii. 22 3 “ A fire is kindled in mine anger, and
shall burn unto the lowest hell’' (the discourse there is about
the wrath of God consuming that people; see ver. 20, 21),
“ and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set 011
fire the foundations of the mountains.'' J er. iv. 233 “ I be-
held the earth, and lo, it was without form and void3 and the
heavens, and they had no light‚'’ 820. The discourse there
also is concerning the destruction of that nation, Isa. lxv. 17 3
“ Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former shall not be remembered‚” 850. And more passages
of this sort among the prophetS. According to this sense,
