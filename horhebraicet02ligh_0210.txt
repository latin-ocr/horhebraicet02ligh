204 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xii. 24.

idolatry], there is hope. Thou canst not bring them [into
the church]‚ because they have stretched forth their hands
‘75:132 in α dunyhz'll .· but yet you cannot reject them= because

they have repented.'' And a little after, ΓῙῬΞἸΌ nm& rim
’ἸᾹἸ Ηῖζῖἶῖ “ He that sees them ⁶ dzcnqiny' [for UUZYD, that is,
‘ sacrffioinq'] to an idol, let him say, Cursed be he that sacri-
fices to a strange god.’'

Let them therefore, who dare, form this word in Matthew
into Beelzebub. I am so far from doubting that the Phari-
sees pronounced the word Beelzebal, and that Matthew so
wrote it, that Ι doubt not but the sense fails if it be writ
otherwise.

III. Very many names of evil spirits or devils occur in the
Talmudists, which it is needless here to mention. Among all
the devils, they esteemed that devil the worst, the fonlest,
and, as it were, the prince of the rest, who ruled over the
idols, and by whom oracles and miracles were given forth
among the heathens and idolaters. And they were of this
opinion for this reason, because they held idolatry above all
other things chiefly wicked and abominable, and to be the
prince and head of evil. This demon they called ³723.ss ‘92⁷2
Romal-zebul, not so much by a proper name, as by one more
general and common3 as much as to say, the Zord of idolatry:
the worst devil, and the worst thing: and they called him the
“ prince of devils,” because idolatry is the prince (or chief) of
wickedness.

W e meet with a storyq, where mention is made of ῙἿΠΞἾ
wrm-5 the prim-e qf spirits. Whether it be in this sense,
let the render consult and judge. Also in the Aruchr we
meet with these words, ΝΠΠἾἾἾ ῑἾΠΞἾ purum& &ww tlze
demon Asmodeus, tlze prinae cf spirits.

IV. The Talmudists, being taught by these their fathers,
do give out, horribly blaspheming, that J esus of Nazareth our
Lord was a magician, a broacher of strange and wicked wor-
ship3 and one that did miracles by the power of the devil, to
beget his worship the greater belief and honour.
