devil in like manner puts on the good angel here, clothed
with light and feigned glory.

ΙΙ. He endeavours to ensnare Christ by “the lust of the
flesh ;” “ command that these stones be made bread :'' by
“ the lust of the eye ;” “ All these things will I give thee, and
the glory of them :²² by ‘⁶ the pride of life 3⁵³ “ ⁶ Throw thyself
down‚' and fly in the air, and be held up by angels.”

Ver. 5: Ἐπὶ τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ἱεροῦ* Upon the pz'mzaole of
the Temple] Whether he placed him upon the Temple itself,
or upon some building within the holy circuit, it is in vain to
seek, because it cannot be found. [f it were upon the Temple
itself, I should refieot upon the top of the 0³75& porclc of the
Temple: is upon some other building, I should reflect upon
the Στοὰν βασιλικὴυ, the νομαί qalleffy. The priests were
wont sometimes to go up to the top of the Temple, stairs
being made for this purpose, and described in the Talmudic
book entitled Middothm 3 and they are said to have ascended
hither, “ when ¹¹ fire was first put to the Temple, and to have
thrown up the keys of the chambers of the Temple towards
heaven, with these words 3 ‘ Ο thou eternal Lord, because we
are not worthy to keep these keys, to thee they are delivered.’
And there came, as it were, the form of a hand out of heaven,
and took them from them: and they leaped down, and fell
into the fire.'’

Above all other parts of the Temple the mlv& percle osche
Temple, yea, the whole πρόναου, space before it, may not un-
fitly be called τὸ πτερύγιον τοῦ ἱεροῦ, the ποίης] of the Temple,
because, like winqs, it extended itself in breadth on each side,
far beyond the breadth of the Temple: which we take notice
of elsewhere.

If, therefore, the devil had placed Christ in the very pre-
cipice of this part of the Temple, he may well be said to have
placed him upon the winy of the Temple, both because this
part was like a wing to the Temple itself‚ and that that pre-
cipice was the winy of this part.

But if you suppose him placed ἐπὶ στοὰν βασιλικὴν, upon tlze
royac yallery, look upon it thus painted out by Josephus:
