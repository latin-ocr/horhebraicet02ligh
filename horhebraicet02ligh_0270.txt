Ver. 21: Πώλησόν σου τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, καὶ δὸς πτωχοῖς· Sell
that ίΙιοῑι least, and qive to the poor] When Christ calls it
perfection to 8611 all and give 10 1116 poor, he speaks ac-
cording 10 1116 idiom of the nation, which thought so: and he
tries this rich man, boasting of his exact performance of the
law, whether, when he pretended to aspire to eterna} life, he
would aspire 10 that perfection which his countrymen so
praised. Not that hence he either devoted Christiana to
voluntary poverty, or that he exhorted this inan to rest ulti-
mately in a Pharisaical peifection ‚· but lifting up his mind to
the renouncing of worldly things, he provokes him to it by
the very doctrine of the Pharisees which he professed.

“ ForS these things the measure is not stat-ed; for the
corner of the field” to be left for the poci-3 “for the first-
fruits for the appearance in the Temple'’ (according to the
law, Exod. xxiii. 15, 17, where, what, or how great an obla-
tion is to 116 brought, is not appointed). “ for the shewing
mercy, and for the study of the law.” The casuists, discuss-
ing that point of ‘ shewing mercy,' dc thus determine con-
cerning it: ‘⁶ A stated measure is not indeed prescribed 10
1116 shewing of mercy, as to thet afforsling poor men help
with thy body,’' that is, with thy bodily labour3 “ but as 10
money there is a stated measure, namely, the fifth part of
thy wealtln nor 18 any bound 10 give the poor above the fifth
part of his estate, FUTUT'Y wrm: l: run-J DN *5237 unless
he does it out of eoetraordimtry devotion. See Rambam upon
1116 place, and 1116 Jerusalem Gemara: where the example
of R. lshbab is produced, (list-ributing all his goods 10 1116
poor.
