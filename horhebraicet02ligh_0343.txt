Ch. xxvi. 6.] Emer-citatiores upon St. Matthew. 337

came‚” Sco. When was it that J udas came to the priests to
treat about betraying Christ? surely before the first day of
unleavened bread. Luke also, whom we quoted before, pro-
ceeds in the very same method: “ From that time (say they),
he sought for an opportunity to betray him.'’ If then first
he went to and agreed with the priests when he rose up
from the paschal supper, as many suppose, he did not then
seek for an opportunity, but had found one. The manner of
speaking used by the evangeliste most plainly intimates some
space of deliberation‚ not sudden execution.

5. Let those words of John be considered, chap‚ xiv. 31,
Ἐγείρεσθε, ἄγωμεν ἐντεῦθεν, sir-ise, let us 90 hence, and com-
pared with the words, chap. xviii. 1, “When J esus had spoken
these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook
Cedron.” Do not these speak of two plainly different de-
partures3 Did not Christ rise up and depart when he said,
“ Arise, let us go hence 3³² Those words are brought in by the
evangelist without any end or design, if we are not to under-
stand by them that Christ immediately changed his place:
and certainly this change of place is different from that which
followed the paschal supper, John xviii. 1.

6. In that thirteenth chapter of John there is not the
least mention nor syllable of the paschal supper. There is,
indeed, plain mention of a supper before the fhast of the Pass-
over, that is, before the festival day; but of a paschal supper
there is not one syllable. I profess seriously, Ι cannot wonder
enough how interpreters could apply that chapter to the
paschal supper, when there is not only no mention at all in
it of the paschal supper, but the evangelist hath also pro-
nounced, in most express words, and than which nothing can
be more plain, that that supper of which he speaks was not
on the feast of the Passover, but before'the feast.

7. If those things which we meet with, John xiii, of the
sop given to Judas, &c. were acted in the paschal supper,
then how, I pray, was it possible for the disciples to mistake
the meaning of those words, “What thou doest, do quickly 3³³
In the paschal supper he said, “ He that dips with me in the
dish is he ;'’ and the hand of Judas, as some think, was at
that very moment in the dish. To J udas asking, “ Is it 1 3”

he plainly answered, “ Thou hast said :’‘ and besides, he gave
