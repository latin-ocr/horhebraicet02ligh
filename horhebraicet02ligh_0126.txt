from this law) the issue of this might be to the women, by
reason of the roughness of the men3 lusting‚ perhaps, after
other women, and loathing their own wives3 he more gra-
eiously provided against such kind of wife-killing by a law,
mitigating the former, and allowed the putting away a wife
in the same case, concerning which that fatal law was given ;
namely, in the ease of adultery. So that that law of divorce,
in the exhibition of it, implied their hearts to be hard3 and,
in the use of it, they shewed them to be carnal. And yet hear
them thus beasting of that law : ‘¹ The n Lord of Israel saith,
Πῖῗζ] ἃξζ) ’Ξ That he hatath pulling] away, Mal. ii. 16. Through
the whole chapter, saith R. Chananiah in the name of R. Phi-
neas⁷ he is called the Lord of Hosfs .· but here, of Israel, that
it might appear that Grod subscribecl not his name to divorces,
but only among the Israelites. As if he should say, ‘ To the
Israelites l have granted the putting away of wives; to the
Gentiles I have not granted it.) R. Chaijah Rabbah saith,
Divorces are not granted t0 the nations of the world?

Some of them interpreted this law of Moses (as by right
they ought to interpret it), of the ease of adultery only. “ The0
school of Shammai said, A wife is not to be divorced, unless

for filthiness [that is, adultery] only, because it is said, ”23¹³
Ἷέᾙ UD? Πζὶ &35⁷3 Because lte bath fhuozdfiltky ozakedness in
hers that is, adultery. Ἰ

“ Rabh Papa saidP, If he find not· adultery in her, what
then? Babba answered, When the mereiful God revealed eon-
cerning him that corrupted a maid, that it was not lawful for
him to put her away in his whole life (Deut. xxii. 29), you are
thence taught concerning the matter propounded‚ that it is
not lawful to put her away, if he shall not find filthiness in his
wife.”

With the like honesty have some commented upon those
words cited out of the prophet, Πίἓῖζῖ mi? '³2 For lae lcatetlz
pnttiny away. “ R. J ochanan saithq, The putting away of a
wife is odi(›ns.” Which others also have granted, indeed, of
the first wife, but not of those that a man took to himself
over and above. For this is approved among them for a canon,
