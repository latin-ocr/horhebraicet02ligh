written, Joohanan, {lae first-born, it means this; that he was
the first-born to the kingdom ε that is, he first reigned. And
R. Jochanan saith, Shallum and Zedekias are the same.
And when it is written, Zedekias the third Shallum the
fourth3 he was the third in birth, but he reigned fourth.”
The same things are produced in the tract Sotahss. But
R. Kimohit much more correctly: ‘⁴ Shallum (saith he) is
J echonias, who had two names, and was reckoned for the son
of Josias, when he was his grandchild” (or the son of his
son) ; ‘⁴ for the sons of sons are reputed for sons.'' Compare
Jer. xxii. ver. 11 with 243 and the thing itself speaks it,

that dignity of the house of David, whatsoever 11 was, which
was altogether withered in the rest of the sons of J osiah, but
did sonlewhat flourish again in him, 2 Kings xxv. 27. And
hence it is, that of all the posterity of J osiah, J echonias only
is named by St. Matthew.

J echonias, in truth, was ἄτεκνος, without children, Jer.
xxii. 303 and Salathiel, properly speaking, was the son of
Neri, Luke iii. 27: but yet Jechonias is said to beget him;
not that he was truly his father, but that the other was his
successor3 not, indeed, in his kingly dignity, for that was
now perished, but in that which now was the chief dignity
among the Jews. So Ι Chron. iii. 16, Zedekias is called the
son, either of J ehoiakim, whose brother indeed he was, or of
J echonias, whose uncle he was ς because he succeeded him in
the kingly dignity.

The Lord had declared, and that not without an cath,
that J echonias should be ἿἾῘἾΣ without children. The Tal-

mudists do so interpret ὝἿἿἿᾷ-ζὲ “ R. Judah saith ¹1, All they
