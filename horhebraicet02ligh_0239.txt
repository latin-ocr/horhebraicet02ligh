Oh. xvi. 13.] Ererce'mtions upon St. Matthem. ,⁶233

Sometimes it is used in a better sense ; “ The Rabbins say Ζ,
Blessed is that judge who leaveneth his judgment.” But
thisa is not to be understood concerning doctrine, but con-
cerning deliberation in judgment.

II. Because very exact care was taken by the Pharisaical
canons, what leaven was to be used and what not, disputa-
tions occur here and there, whether heathen leaven is to be
used, and whether Guthite leavenb, Sec. With which cau-
tion the disciples thought that Christ armed them, when he
spake concerning the leaven of the Pharisees: but withal
they suspected some silent reproof for not bringing bread
along with them.

Ver. 13: Τίνα με λέγουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι εἶναι, τὸν viba· τοῦ
ἀνθρώπου; W Imm do men says that I the Son of man am .P]
Ι. That phrase or title, the Son of man, which Christ very
often gives himself, denotesC not only his humanity, nor his
humility (for see that passage, John v. 27, “He hath given
him authority of executing judgment, because he is the Son
of man”) ; but it bespeaks the ⁶ seed promised to Adam, the
second Adam ε’ and it carried with it a silent- confutation of
a double ignorance and error among the Jews: I. They knew
not what to resolve upon concerning the original of the
Messias3 and how he should rise, whether he should be of
the living, as we noted before, the manner of his rise being
unknown to them; or whether of the dead. This phrase
unties this knot and teaches openly, that he, being a seed
promised to the first man, should arise and be born from the
seed of the woman. 2. They dreamed of the earthly vic-
tories of the Messias, and of nations to be subdued by him;
but this title, The Son qs man, recalls their minds to the first
promise, where the victory of the promised seed is the bruising
of the serpent’s head, not the subduing of kingdoms by some
warlike and earthly triumph.

II. When, therefore, the opinion of the Jews concerning
the person of the Messias, what he should be, was uncertain
and wavering, Christ asketh, not so much whether they ac-
knowledged him the Messias, as acknowledging the Messias,
what kind of person they conceived him to be. The apostles
