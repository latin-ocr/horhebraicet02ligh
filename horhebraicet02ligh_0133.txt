Fourthly, Pl'l'ly ny'm'tz) A testimonial oatlc, before a judge
or magistrate.

In three of these kinds of swearing, care is taken only con-
eerning the truth of the thing sworn, not of the vanity of
swearing.

They seemed, indeed, to make' some provision against a
vain and rash oath: namely, 1. That he be beaten, who so0
swears, and become cursed: which Maimonides hints in the
twelfth chapter of the tract alleged: wit-h whom the Jeru-
salem Gemarists do agree3 ‘⁶ Hei> that swears two is two,
let him be beaten for his vain oath.” 2. They also added
terror to it from fearful examples, such as that is in the very
same place. tenna: ³³57 ΠῪἿΚῬἾΞ ΗἻΞ “ There were twenty-
four assemblies in the south, and they were all destroyed for a
vain oath.'' And in the same tract-q, a woman buried her son
for an oath, διο. Yet they eoncluded vain oaths in so narrow
a circle, that a man might swear a hundred thousand times,
and yet not come within the limits of the caution concerning
vain swearing.

II. It was customary and usual among them to swear by
the creatures3 “ Ifr any swear by heaven, by earth, by the
sun, &a although the mind of the swearer be under these
words to swear by Him who created them, yet this-is not an
oath. Or if any swear by some of the prophets, or by some of
the books of the Scripture, although the sense of the swearer
be to swear by Him that sent that prophet, 01· that gave that
book, nevertheless this is not an oath.”

“ IfS any adjure another by heaven or earth, he is not
guilty.'’

Theyt swore by Heaven. N'ffl 1: D'DIDT'T By Heaven so
it is.

They swore by the Temple„ “Whenu turtles and young
pigeons were sometime sold at Jerusalem for a penny of gold,
Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel said, ἶἿζῖῃΠ ΠῗΠ By this habi-
tation [that is, by this Temple] I will not rest this night, unless
they be sold for a penny of silvei-,²² ’
