6 DEDIOATION.

it, and, if we have not attained it, they will pity us. But as
for the wrinkled forehead, and the stern brow, we are pre-
pared to bear them with all patience, being armed and satis-
fied with this inward patmnage, that ‘⁴ we have endeavoured
to profit. ’³

But this work, whatever it be, and whatever fortune it is
like to meet with, we would dedicate to you, my very dear
Gatharine-Hall men, both as a debt, and as a desire. For
by this most close bond and tie wherewith we are united, to
you is due all that we study, all that we can d0; if so be
that all is any thing at all. And when we desire to profit all
(if we could) which becomes both a student and a Christian
to do; by that bond and your own merits, you are the very
centre and rest of those desires and wishes. We are suffi-
ciently conscious to ourselves how little or nothing we can do
either for the public benefit, or for yours3 yet we would make
a public profession, before all the world, of our desire and
study3 and, before you, of our inward and cordia] affection.

Let this pledge, therefore, of our love and endearment be
laid up by y0u; and, while we endeavour to give others an
account of our hours, let this give you an assurance of our
affections. And may it last in Gatharine-Hall, even to future

ages, as a testimony os service, a monument of love, and a
memorial both os me and you!
