160 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. viii. 2.

OHAP. VIII.

Ver. 2: Azivaffaes με καθαρίσαι· T hou canst make me oleam]
The doctrine in the law concerning leprosy paints out very
well the doctrine of sin.

I. It teacheth, that no creature is so unclean by a touch
as man. Yea‚ it may with good reason be asked, whether
any creature, while it lived, was unclean to the touch, be-
side man? That is often repeated in the Talmudists‚ that
“ he that takes a worm in his hand ὃ, all the waters of Jordan
cannot wash him from his uncleanness;” that is, while the
worm is as yet in his hand3 or the worm being cast away,
not until the time appointed forb such purification be ex-
pired. But whether it is to be understood of a living or
dead worm, it is doubted, not without cause, since the law,
treating of this matter, speaketh only of those things that
died of themselves. See Lev. xi. 31 : ‘⁶ VVhosoever shall touch
them when they be dea<l‚” &oz and ver. 32, ‘⁶ Upon whatso-
ever any of them, when they are dead, shall fall,’' &a But
whether he speaks of a living worm, or a dead, uncleanness
followed by the touch of it for that day only ε for ‘¹ he shall
be unclean (saith the law) until the evening :³⁹ but the carcase
of a man being touched, a week’s uncleanness followed. See
Num. xix.

II. Among all the uncleannesses of men, leprosy was the
greatest, inasmuch as other uncleannesses separated the un-
clean person, or rendered him unclean, for a day, or a week,
or a month3 but the leprosy, perhaps, for ever.

ΙΙΙ. When the leper was purified, the leprosy was not
healed: but the poison of the disease being evaporated, and
the danger of the contagion gone, the leper was restored to
the public congregation. Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, was
adjudged to perpetual leprosy; and yet he was cleansed‚ and
conversed with the king (ει Kings viii. 5) ; cleansed, not healed.
Thus under justification and sanctification there remain still
the seeds and filth of sin.

IV. He that was full of the leprosy was pronounced
