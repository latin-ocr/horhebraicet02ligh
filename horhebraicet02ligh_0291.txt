family of Herod, together with eighty men bravely clad.’'
These, and such as these, I suppose were called Her-odiam,
who partly got into the court, and partly were of the faction
both of the father and son. With how great opposition of
the generality of the Jewish people Herod ascended and
kept the throne, we have observed before. There were some
that obstinately resisted him; others that as much defended
him: to these was deservedly given the title of Herodians‚·
as endeavouring with all their might to settle the kingdom in
his family: and they, it seems, were of the Sadducean faith
and doctrine,- and it is likely had leavened Herod, who was
now tet-rarch, with the same principles. For (as we noted
before) ‘the leaven of the Sadducees' in Matthewe, is in
Markf ‘ the leaven of Herod.' And it was craftily con-
trived on both sides that they might be a mutual establish-
ment to one another, they to his kingdom, and he to their
doctrine. When I read of Manaem or Menahem g, the
foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch h, it readily brings to
my mind the name and story before mentioned of Menahem,
who carried over with him so many eminent persons to the
court of Herod.

subtilty to find out whether Christ were of the same opinion
with J udas of Galilee. Which opinion those lewd disturbers
of all things, whom J osephus brands everywhere under the
name of malms, had taken Up3 stiffly denying obedience and
tribute to a Roman prince3 because they persuaded them-
selves and their followers that it was a sin to submit to a
heathen government. What great calamities the outrageous
fury of this coneeit brought upon the people, both Josephus
and the ruins of Jerusalem at this day testisy. They chose
Gaesar before Christ3 and yet because they would neither
have Caesar nor Christ, they remain sad monuments to all
ages of the divine vengeance and their own madness. To
this fury those frequent warnings of the apostles do relate,
“That every one should submit himself to the higher powers k.”
