To s the Pharisees; that is, to them that eat their common food
in cleanness. Behold, how the word ΕἼἾΞΠ relzlqious, and
pum-522 Pharisees, are convertible terms; and how this was
the proper notion whereby a Pharisee was defined, “ That he
ate his common food in cleanness :'' that is, that he washed his
hands when he ate.

111. We must not think ,that Pharisaism arose altogether
and at once, but it was long a-conceiving, and of no fixed
form when it was brought forth. The same may, in a man-
ner, be said of this, which is of the traditions: both these
and that were the issue of many years. The S traditionarians
do refer the first conception of the Traditions to the times of
Ezra. But how many centuries of years passed before the
birth of this whole monster was full ripe? In like manner,
the first seesls of Pharisaism were cast long before its birth ;
and being now brought forth, was a long time growing, be-
fore it came to maturity3 if so be any can define what its
maturity was.

W e observe presently, that the foundations of Sadduceeism
were laid in the days of Ezra,ssbefore there were any Sad-
ducees: in his days also, I suspect, the foundations of Phari-
saism were laid long before there were any Pkarisees. For,
since the Pharisees were marked with that title because they
separated themselves from other men, as more profane3
and since, in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah, it was the
great care, and that a holy care too, to separate the seed of
Israel from the heathen inhabitants of the land, to wit, the
Samaritam, the Ashdodites, the Moabites, 850„ not much
after ; some men, arrogating too much for themselves, took
occasion hence of separatio& themselves from the men of
the Israelitic seed, as too profane, and very unfit (alas Ξ) for
their communion. Which very thing we experience in our
present Separatists. For when the Scripture commands
Christians that they communicate not “ with unbelievers,
