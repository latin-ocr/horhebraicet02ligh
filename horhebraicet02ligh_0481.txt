further. However, that was the chamber of the high priest,
as appears ostem> in the Talmudists3 not that he always
lived there, nor that once in the year he resorted thither;
but because it was that place where he sat with the council
of the priests, and consulted concerning the public service
and affairs of the Temple. Hence in the Jerusalem writers
mention is made of &maban Dyma> Simeon the eounsellor.
And in this sense is that to be taken, if I mistake not, which
occurs once and again in 1116 Babylonian Talmudists, con-
cerning :Dlffiffnn ΞὊΠΞ ’33 the sons of tlte 111611 priests,
deciding several things; and 0³33: ³71& 1³7 ΠἮ the house of

first appearance of light. “ R. Chaijat Babba, and R. Simeon
Ben Chalaphta, travelling together in a certain morning, in
the valley of Arbel‚ saw the kind ‘ff the morniny, that its light
spread the sky. R. Chaija said, Such shall be the redemption
of Israel. First, It goes forward by degrees, and by little
and little ; but by how much the more it shall go forward, by
so much the more it shall increase.”

It was at that time that Christ arose ; namely, in the first
mornin9; as may be gathered from the words of Matthew.
