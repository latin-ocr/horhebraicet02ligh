of it.'’

And now let the impartial reader judge between the reason
which is given for the transferring the Passover this year
unto the fifteenth day, namely, because of the sabbath fol-
lowing, that they might not be forced to abstain from servile
work for two days together3 and the reason for which it
might with good reason be transferred that year concerning
which the story is. The fourteenth day fell on a sabbath 3
a scruple ariseth, whether the sabbath gives way to the
Passover, or the Passover to the sabbath. The very chief
men of the Sanhedrim‚ and the oracles of traditions, are not
able to resolve the business. A great article of religion is
transacting; and what is here to be done! O ye sons of
Betira, transfer but the Passover unto the next day, and the
knot is untied. Certainly if this had been either usual or
lawful, they had provided that the affairs of religion, and
their authority and fame, should not have stuck in this strait.
But that was not to be suffered.

at: ‘⁵ Fivez things, if they come in uncleanness, are not
eaten in uncleanness: the sheaf of firstfruits‚ the two loaves‚
the shewbread, the peace offerin s of the congregation, and
the goats of the new moons. But ΞΝ] minuo: &an ΠΟΞΠ

eaten.''

Upon which tradition thus Maimonides : “ The Lord saith,
‘ And there were some that were unclean by the carcase of
a man,q Numb. ix. 6, and he determines of them, that they
be put off from the Passover of the first month to the Pass-
over of the second. And the tradition is, that it was thus
determined, because they were few. But if the whole congre-
gation should have been unclean, or if the greatest part of it
should have been unclean, yet they offer the Passover, though
they are unclean. Therefore they say, ‘ Particular men are
put off to the second Passover, but the whole congregation is
not put off to the second Passover. In like manner all the
