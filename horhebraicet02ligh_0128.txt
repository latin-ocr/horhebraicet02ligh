122 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. ν. 31.

ΙΙ. “ Ifx any man hate his wife, let him put her away :''
excepting only that wife that he first married. In like man-
ner, R.Judah thus interprets that of the prophet, δὶὶὶξ Ἶῌ

ΠῖΞΨ If he hate her, let kion put laer away. Which sense some
versions, dangerously enough, have followed. R. Solomon ex-
presses the sense of that place thus: “ lt is commanded to
put away one's wife, if she obtain not favour in the eyes of
her husband.’'

III. ‘⁶ They school of Hillel saith, If the wife cook her hus-
band's food illy, by over-salting or over-roasting it, she is to
be put away.”

IV. Yea, “ If, by any stroke from the hand of God, she be-
come (lumb or sottish,” Sao.

V. But not to relate all the things for which they pro-
nounce a wife to be divorced (among which they produce
some things that modesty allows not to be repeated), let it
be enough to mention that of R. Akibah instead of all : ‘³ R.
Akibah saidz, If any man sees a woman handsomer than his
own wife, he may put her awayz, because it is said, ‘ If she
find not favour in his eyes.' '’

Ἀποστάσιου· Bill qs divor-ce] And βιβλίον ἀποστασίου, Α bill
qf divom, Matt.. xix. 7 ; and in the Septuagint, Deut. xxiv. 1.
Of which Beza thus; “ This bill may seem to be called ἀπο-
στάσιον [115 11111611 115, departinf] away} not in respect of the
wife put away, as of the husband departing away from his
wife.'' Something hard, and diametrically contrary to the
canonical doctrine of the J ews: sor thus they write, ‘⁶ Ita is
written in the bill, Behold, thou art put away3 Behold, thou
art thrust away, &c. But if he writes, Ι am not thy hus-
band, or, I am not thy spouse, ἅπας it is not a just bill: for
it is said, He shall put ker away, not, He shall put laimseff
away.'’

This bill is called by the J ews mrim: 5²:³0 a bill of onttinq
