Ch. xii. 3.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 197

Concerning which the Fathers of the Traditions write thus3

the sabbath, though never so little, is guilty. And to pluck

the ears of corn is a kind of reaping3 and whosoever plucks
any thing from the springing of his own fruit is guilty, under
the name of a reaper.” But under what guilt were they
held? He had said this before, at the beginning of chap. vii,
in these words: “ The works whereby a man is guilty of
stoning and cutting off, if he do them presumptuouslyg but
if ignorantly, he is bound to bring a sacrifice sor sin, ἶΠῃ

the sheaves, to thrash, to sift, to grind, to bake, &c.; to shear

same rank with grindingz, and plucking the ears of corn is
of the same nature with reaping. Our Saviour, therefore,
pleaded the cause of the disciples so much the more eagerly,
because now their lives were in danger; for the canons of
the scribes adjudged them to stoning for what they had done,
if so be it could be proved that they had done it presumptu-
ously. From hence, therefore, he begins their defence‚ that
this was done by the disciples out of necessity, hunger com-
pelling them, not out of any contempt of the laws.

that noble train wherewith thou wast wont to go attended,
and which becomes the captain-general of Israel. David
came to Nob, not as one that fied, but as one that came to

he pretended to come by the king’s command. Dissembling‚
