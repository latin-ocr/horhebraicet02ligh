they should not think or imagine that it is lawful to bake any
thing on a feast day which is not eaten that day: therefore

The sum of the matter is this, many families dwelt by one
common court. Now therefore when it was not lawful to
carry out any thing on the sabbath Γῆζζὶήῖῖ· numan from a
place which was osone riyht and condition, to a place which was
of another5 therefore it was not lawful for any one of those
families to carry out any thing out of his house into the court
joining to his door, and on the contrary3 all partook of the

the lamb3 but the preparation of meats to be eaten in the
Passover week. Nor in this place, if it be applied to the
sabbath, doth it denote any other thing than tlte preparation
ofsbod for the sabbath now approaching. So that that day
wherein Christ was crucified was a double preparation in
the double sense alleged: namely, the whole day, but espe-
