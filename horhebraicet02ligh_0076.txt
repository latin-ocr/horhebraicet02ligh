From hence it appears that the women that embraced
Pharisaism did it of their own free will and vow, not by
command: which the men-Pharisees also did.

2. Pass we from the women to the men3 and, first, to the
lowest degrees of men in the distinction relating to religion ;
namely, to them whom they ordinarily called aa: maerente,
and ΫἾΝΠ my the people of the earth, or the plebeiam. Of
them, thus the Gemara in Sotahh newly cited: “ One reads
the Scriptures, and recites the Μ18110, and yet he waits not
upon the scholars of the wise men ; what of him? R. Eleazar
said, ΥἾΝΠ Dy ΠΤ This is o‘ne of the people of tke earth.
R. Samuel Bar Nachmani saith, ww: Πῖ *affl Belzold, this
is an ’ῖίίίΐεναΐε man. R. Jannai saith, ‘ Behold, this is a
Guthean? R. Achabar saith, ⁶ Behold, this is a magi-
cian.'” And a little after, “ Who is ῩἻΝΠ :127 {lae people of
the earth ‚9 R. Meith saith, ⁶ He that recites not his phy-
lacteries morning and evening with his prayerS. But the
wise 111011 say, ‘ He, whosoever he be, that lays not up his
phylacteries? Ben Azzai saith, ‘He who hath not a fringe
on his garlnent! R. Jochanan Ben ,loseph saith, ‘He that
instructs not his sons in the doctrine of the laW.' Others
say, ‘ He who, although he read the ScriptureS‚ and repeats
the traditione, yet attends not on the scholare of the wise
men, this is, 17⁰3? the people of the earth [or tlze plebeiam]
Does he read the Scriptures, and not repeat the tradition? ⁴
Behold, this man is ἻἹἎ illiterata) The Gloss upon the
place speaks thus, ·'‘ Tloe people of tlte earth are the-y of whom
there is suspicion of tenths and cleanness :’' that is, lest they
111110 1101 rightly, nor take care aright· concerning cleansings.
And ww: the illiterata person is ''Unym yffi] more vile than, or
inferior to, the people of the earth.” Compare that, John vii. 49,
“ this people that knoweth not the law 18 cursed.''

Thei ΕἾἾἮΠ and ’ΞὍΞΠ ἾἾἾῃζῖΠ colleayues or associantes,
and scholast-5 of the wisa men, were opposed to these vulgar
persons. Under the title of D‘DDN *W'Dlvn scholam· of tlte
wisa men, are compre-hended all that were learned and
studious : under the title of ΕἾἾΞΠ νᾶῖὶθὶοαε, 08 well learned
