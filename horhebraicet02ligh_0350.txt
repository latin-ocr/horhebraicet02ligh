II. The Israelites accounted such lying down in eating a
very fit posture requisito in sacred feasts, and highly requisite
and most necessary in the Paschal supper: “ Wep do not use
lying down but only to a morsel,'' &c. “ And indeed to
those that did eat leaning, leaning was necessary. But now
our sitting is a kind of leaning along. They were used to lean
along every one on his own couch, and to eat his meat on his
own table: but we eat all together at one table.”

tzion: -ω ³7:2³2* ΝΒ ‘ammio ’π’ alvis& Evenq the
poorest Israelita must not eat till he lies down. The canon is
speaking about the Paschal supper3 on which thus the Baby-
lonians: “It is said that the feast of unleavened bread
requires leaning or lying down, but the bitter herbs not:
concerning wine, it is said in the name of Rabh Nachman
that it hath need of lying down: and it is said in the name
of Rabh Nachman‚ that it hath not need of lying down : and
yet these do not contradict one another; for that is said of
the two first cup8, this of the two lastr.'' They lie down on
the left side, not on the right, “ because they must necessarily
use their right hand in eating.” So the Gloss there.

III. They used and were fond of that custom of lying
down, even to superstition, because it carried with it a token
and signification of liberty: “R. Levi saiths, It is the manner
of slaves to eat standing: but now let them eat lying along,
that it may be known that they are gone out of bondage to
liberty. R. Simon in the name of R. Joshua Ben Levia Let
that which a man eats at the Passover, and does his duty,
though it be but as big as an olive, let it be eaten lying
along.'’ “ Theyu eat the unleavened bread the first night
lying down, because it is a commemoration of deliverance.
The bit-ter herbs have no need of lying down, because they
are in memory of bondage. Although it be the bread of
affliction, yet it is to be eaten after the manner of liberty.”
