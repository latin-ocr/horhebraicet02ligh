“Thes Rabbins deliver. In the first year of that week [of
years] that the Son of David is to come, shall that be fulfilled,
‘ I will rain upon one city, but I will not rain upon another‚'
Amos iv. 7. The second year, the arrows of famine shall be
sent forth. The third, the famine shall be grievous, and men
and women and children, holy men, and men of good works,
shall die. And there shall be a forgetfulness of the law
among those that learn it. The fourth year, fulness, and not
fulness. The fifth year, great fulness3 for they shall eat and
drink and rejoice, and the law shall return to its scholars.
The sixth year, voices. (The Gloss is, ‘ A fame shall be
spread, that the Son of David comes‚' or, ‘they shall sound
with a trumpet.') The seventh year, wars; and in the going
out of that seventh year the Son of David shall come.''

The prophet here says two things :—

I. That Christ should be born before the destruction of
Jerusalem. The Jews themselves collect and acknowledge
this out of this prophecy: “ Itt is in the Great Genesis,
[Bereslzith Babba] a very ancient book: thus R. Samuel Bar
Nachaman said, Whence prove you, that in the day when the
destruction of the Temple waS, Messias was born? He answered,
From this that is said in the last chapter of Isaiah, ‘ Before she
travailed she brought forth; before her bringing forth shall
come, she brought forth a male child? In the same hour that
