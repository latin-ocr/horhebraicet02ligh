In the early spring of this year came John baptizing. In
the mouth Tisri Christ is baptized‚ when he had now ac-
oomplished the nine—and-twentieth year of his age, and had
now newly entered upon his thirtieth. The thirtieth of Christ
is to be reckoned with the sixt-eenth of Tiberius.

Of Augustus, now entering upon his one-and-thirtieth year,
wherein Christ was born, Dion Cassius hath moreover these
words: Πληρωθείσης δὲ καὶ τῆς τρίτης δεκαετίας, τὴν ἡγημουίαν
καὶ τὸ τέταρτον ἐκβιασθεὶς δῆθεν ὑπεδέξατο, πρᾳότερός τε καὶ
ὀκνηρότερος ὑπὸ τοῦ γήρως· “ Having now completed thrice ten
years, being compelled, indeed, to it, he continued his govern-
ment, and entered upon a fourth ten of years: being now
more easy and slothful by reason of age.” In this very year

was the taxation under Cyrenius, of which Luke speaks,
chap. ii. So that if it be asked when the fifth monarchy of

the Romans arose, after the dissolution of those four men-
tioned by Daniel, an easy answer may be fetched from St.
Luke, who relates that in that very year wherein Christ was
born, Augustus laid a tax upon the whole world.

III. Christ was born in the thirty-fifth year of the reign
of Herod: which we gather from the observation of these
things: 1. Herodq reigned, from that time he was first de-
clared king by the Romans seven-and-thirty years. 2. Be-
tween the death of Herod and the death ofAugustus there
was this space of time ·.

1. The r ten years current of the reign of Archelaus.

2. CoponiuSS succeeds him, banished to Vienna in the

presidentship of Judea.
