stroys “ three evil shepherds,'’ namely, the Pha-fisce, and the
Sadducee, and the Essene.

‘'Onm πᾶς ὁ ὀργιζόμευος τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὑτοῦ εἰκῆ, 8120. Thac
whosoever is anfi-y with his brother without a cause, &c.] First
let us treat of the words, and then of the sentences.

With his brother] The J ewish 50110015 do thus distinguish
between a brother and a neighbour3 that α brother· signifies
an Israelite by nation and blood: a ozeigylzbour, an Israelite in
religion and worship, that is, a proselyte. The author of
Aruch, in the word ΠἾἾΞ 32 A son of the covenant, writes
thus; “ The sons of the covenant‚ these are Israel. And
when the Scripture saith, ⁶ If any one's ox gore the ox of his
neighbour,' it excludes all the heathen, in that it saith, ‘of
his neighbour.''’ Maimonides writes thus3 “Itu is all one
to kill an Israelite and a Canaanite servant: for both, the
punishment is death; but an Israelite who shall kill ΞΨἾΠ *m
a strmzyer-inkabitant shall not be punished with death, be-
cause it is said, ‘ Whosoever shall proudly rise up against his
neighbour to kill him,’ Exod. xxi. 14: and it is needless to
say he shall not be punished with death for killing a heathen.”
Where this is to be noted, that heathens and stranger-in-
habitantS‚ who were not admitted to perfect and complete
proselytism‚ were not qualified with the title of owiylcbour,
nor with any privileges,

But under the Gospel, where there is no distinction of na-
tions or tribes, brother is taken in the same latitude as among
the Jews both brother and neiylzbour were3 that is, for all pro-
fessing the gospel : and is contradistinguished to the heatken,
1 Gor. v. 11, “ If 'any one who is called a brother :'' and Matt.
xviii. 15, “ If thy brother sin against thee‚'' &c., ver. 17, “ If
he hear not the church, let him be a heatken.''

But0 neiylcbour 15 extended to all, even such as are strangers
to our religion: Luke x, 29, 30, 810.
