Ch. xxi. 9.] Exercitations upon Sc. Mattkew. 273

On every day of the feast, they used once to go round
the altar with bundles in their hands, singing this, ’Π NJ&
N] T‘U‘l'lvssn'ss ’Π ΝΣ &Yam-T Save now, I beseeok thee, Ο
Lord; I beseecla thee, O Lord, send now prosperity. But on
the seventh day of the feast they went seven times round
the altark‚ &c. “ The tossing or shaking of the bundles
was on the right hand, on the left hand, upwards and
downwardsl.”

‘⁶ The reason of the bundles was this, because it is written,
‘ 'rhen let all the trees of the wood sing‚' (Psalm xcvi. 12.)
Ansl afterward it is written, ‘ Give thanks unto the Lord,
because he is good‚' (psalm cvi. Ι.) And afterward, ‘ Save
us, O Lord, Ο our Θτοᾰ,7 &c. (Psalm cvi. 47.) And the reason
is mystical. In the beginning of the year, Israel and the
nations of the world go forth to judgment 3 and being igno-
rant who are to be cleared and who guilty, the holy and
blessed God commanded Israel that they should rejoice with
these bundles, as a man rejoiceth who goeth out of the pre-
sence of his judge acquitted. Behold, therefore, what is
written, ‘ Let the trees of the wood sing ;’ as if it were said,
Let them sing with the trees of the wood, when they go out
justified from the presence of the Lord,’' &mm

These things being premised concerning the rites and cus-
toms of that feast, we now return to our story :—-

I. It is very much worth our observation, that the com-
pany receives Christ coming now to the Passover with the
solemnity of the feast of Tabernacles. For what hath this
to do with the time of the Passover3 If one search into the
reason of the thing more accurately, these things occur3
First, The mirth of that feast above all others3 concerning
which there needs not much to be said, since the very name
of the feast (for by way of emphasis it was called m, that
is, Festivity or Mirm) sufficiently proves it. Secondly‚ That
prophecy of Zeohariahn‚ which, however it be not to be un-
derstood according to the letter, yet from thence may suffi-
ciently be gathered the singular solemnity and joy of that
least above all others3 and, perhaps, from that same pro-
