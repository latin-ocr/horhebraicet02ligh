some do hence make a pretence of withdrawing themselves
from the assemblies of Christians: by what right, by what
foundation, let themselves look to it.

We shall th trace the time wherein the name of Pha-
risee first arose ς this is done by learneder men: and there-
fore let it be enough to have observed that only. After
once this pretence of religion was received, “ that it- was a
pious matter to separate a man”s self from the common peo-
ple,’' superstition increased every day, which served for a
stay and patronage to this sect and separation. For when
they had espoused a religion so superciliOUS, that they com-
monly said, “ Stand off, I am holier than thou'' (which was
also foretold by the prophet with an execration, Isa. lxv. 5.)‚
and that they placed the highest sanctimonyt in this, to
withdraw themselves from the common people, as profane3
it was certainly necessary to circumscribe, and to put them-
selves under a more austere rule and discipline, that they
might retain the name and ie of religious persons in other
things besides that separa son, that argued so much pride
and arrogancy. Hence the troubles about tithings and
washings arose, and increased age after age: hence sprang
the frequent fastings and prayers, the cares of the phylacte-
ries', fringes, and other matters without number: so that (a
thing fatal to Separatists) this sect, at last, was erumbled
into sects, and a Pharisee was, in a manner, the same to a
Pharisee, that the people of the earth was to a Pharisee.

Bothu Talmuds reckon seven sects of Pharisees, and so
does the Aruohx: which it will not be irksome to describe
with their pencil‚ that the reader may see to what a degree
of madness this sect was come, as well as to what a degree of
hypocrisy. ζΠ ῙἾΨἹἾΞ ΠὨΞΨ The Pharisees are seven .·
