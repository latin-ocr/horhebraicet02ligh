I'ffifllv rm The collectors of alms may not separate themselves
one from another, unless that one may 90 by himself to the qaae,
aad another to the shop. That is, as the Gloss explains it,
they might not gather this alms separately and by them-
selves3 that no suspicion might arise, that they privily con-
verted what was given to their own use and benefit. This
only was allowed the1n; when they went to the gate, one
might betake himself to the gate, and another to a shop near
it, to ask of the dwellers in both places: yet with this pro-
viso, that withal both were within sight of one anot-her. So
that at each door it might be seen that this alins was re-
ceived by the collectors. And here was no probability at all
of a trumpet, when this alins was of the lowest degree, being
to be bestowed upon vagabond strangers, and they very often

townsmen by two Parnasia, of whom before, to whom also a
third was added, for the distributing it. The Babylonian
Gemarists give a reason of the number, not unworthy to be
marked: “A tradition of the Rabbins. The alms'·chest is

Thisz alms was collected in the synagogue, on the sab-
bath (oompare 1 Oor. xvi. 2.), and it was distributed to the
poor on the sabbath-eve. Hence is that, 5³:127 :Syn ΠΞἾῙῺ

Whether, therefore, the trumpet sounded in the synagogue
when alme were done, it again remains obscure, since the
Jewish canonists do not openly mention it, while yet they
treat of these alms very largely. Indeed, every synagogue
had its trumpet. For,
