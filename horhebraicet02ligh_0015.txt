Ch. i. 1.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 9

mation of the people (which you may see in those things that
follow at the place alleged), there was some necessity to lay
up public records of pedigrees with them: whence it might
be known what family was pure, and what defiled. Hencee
that of Simon Ben Azzai deserves our notice : “ I saw (saith
he f) a genealogical scroll in Jerusalem, in which it was thus
written3 ‘N., a bastard of a strange wife.'” Observe, that
even a bastard was written in their public books of genealogy,
that he might be known to be a bastard, and that the purer
families might take heed of the defilement of his seed. Let
that also be notedg: “ They found a book of genealogy at
Jerusalem, in which it was thus written3 ‘ Hillel was sprung
from David4 Ben J atsaph from Asaph. Ben Tsitsith Hac-
ceseth from Abner. Ben Cobisin from Achab‚'” &a And
the records of the genealogies smell of those things which are
mentioned in the text of the Misna concerning ‘ wood—car-
rying :² ‘⁵ The h priests' and people’s times of wood-carrying
were nine : on the first day of the month Nisan, for the sons
of Erach, the sons of J udah : the twentieth day of Tammuz‚
for the sons of David, the son of J udah: the fifth day of Ab,
for the sons of Parosh, the son of Judah: the seventh of the
same month for the sons of J onadab the son of Rechab: the
tenth of the same for the sons of Senaah, the son of Benja-
min,³' &a

It is, therefore, easy to guess whence Matthew took the
last fourteen generations of this genealogy, and Luke t-he
first forty names of his 3 namely, from the genealogical scrolls
at that time well enough known, and laid up in the public
κειμήλια, repositories, and in the private also. And it was ne-
cessary, indeed, in so noble and sublime a subject, and a thing
that would be so much inquii-ed into by the J ewish people
as the lineage of the Messiah would be, that the evangelists
should deliver a truth, not only that could not be gainsaid‚
but also that might be proved and established from certain
and undoubted rolls of ancestors.

is so often added to the name of Christ in the New Testa-
