troverted by the J ews-

Of the same nature is that apostolic blessing, “ Gracc and
peace from God the Father, and from our Lord J esus Christ?7
WVhere then is the Holy Ghost? He is not excluded, however
he be not named. The Jews did more easily consent to the
Spirit of the Messias, which they very much celebrate, than
to the person of the Messias, Above all others, they dcny and
abjure Jesus of Nazareth. It belonged to the apostles,

Jews into the name of Jesus, the Son .· and the Gentiles,
into the noc-me of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holps
Ghost.
