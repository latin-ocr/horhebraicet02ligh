Vm. 1 : Τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐληλυθυῖαν ἐν δυνάμει· lee
kinydom of God coming) in power] In Matbhew, it is τὸν υἱὸν
τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐρχόμενον ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ αὐτοῦ, the Son of man
coming] in his kinydoon. The coming of Christ in his vengeance
and power 10 destroy the unbelieving and mosb wicked nation
of 1116 Jews is expressed under these forms of speech. Hence
1116 day of judgment and vengeance :

Ι. It is called “ 1116 great and terrible day of 1116 Lord‚’'
Acts ii. 2ος 2 Thess. ii. 2, 3.

II. 11 is described as “ 1116 end of 1116 ννοΓΙά,” J er. iv. 27 ;
Matt. xxiv. 29, &c.

III. In that phrase, ‘⁵ in 1116 last times? Isa. ii. 2 ; Acts ii,
173 1 Tim. iv. 13 2 Pet. iii. 33 that is, in 1116 last times of that
city and dispensation.

IV. Thence, 1116 beginning of 1116 “ new world,'' Isa. lxv. 173
2 Pet. iii. 13.

1116 clouds,'' Rev. i. 7 ε “ 111 glory with 1116 angels,” Matt.
xxiv. 30, 816.

VI. Ι1 is described as 1116 ‘ enthroning of Christ, and his
twclvc apostles judging 1116 twclve tribes of Israel,' Mat-fo. xix,
283 Luke xxii. 30.

Hence this is 1116 sense of the present place: Our Saviour
had said in 1116 last verse of 1116 former chapter, “ Whosoever
shall be ashamed of 1116 and of my words in this adulterous
and sinful generation; of him also shall 1116 Son of man be
ashzmed, when he 601116111 in 1116 glory of his Father with
1116 holy angels‚'' 10 take punishment of that adulterous and
sinful generation. And he suggests, with good reason, that
that his coming in glory should be in 1116 lifetime of some
that stood there.

Ver. 2: Εἷς ὅρος ὑψηλόν Into a kiqk mountain] Now
