314 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxiv. 20, 22.

that which is determined shall be poured out upon the deso-
late.' Flatter not yourselves, therefore, with vain hopes,
either of future victory, or of the retreating of that army,
but provide for yourselves3 and he that is in J udea, let him
fly to the hills and places of most difficult access, not into the
city.” See how Luke clearly speaks out this sense in the
twentieth verse of the one-and-twentieth chapter.

Ver. 20: Ἵνα μὴ γένηται ἡ φυγὴ ὑμῶν χειμῶνος· ΤῘιαύ your
stifft be not in tlte winter] R. Tanchum observes a favour of
God in the destruction of the first Temple, that it happened
in the summer, not in winter. For thus he x : “ God vouch-
safed a great favour to Israe13 for they ought to have gone
out of the land on the tenth day of the month Tebeth, as he
saith, ‘ Son of man, mark this day3 for on this very day,' &a
What. then did the Lord, holy and blessed? ‘ If they shall now
go out in the winter,' saith he, ‘ they will all die :⁹ therefore
he prolonged the time to them, and carried them away in
summer.’'

Ver. 225': Κολοβωθήσονται αἱ ἡμέραι ἐκεῖναι· Tho-5⁶6 days
shall be skortened] God lengthened the time for the sake of
the elect, before the destruction of the city; and in the de-
struction, for their sakes he shortened it. Compare with
these words before us 2 Pet. iii. 9, “ The Lord is not slack
concerning his promise‚” διο. It was certainly very hard
with the elect that were inhabitants of the city, who under-
went all kinds of misery with the besieged, where the plague
and sword raged so violently that there were not living
enough to bury the dead; and the famine was so great, that
a mother ate her son (perhaps the wife of Doeg Ben J oseph,
of whom see such a story in Babyl. Joma Ζ). And it was
also hard enough with those elect who fied to the mountains,
being driven out of house, living in the open air, and wanting
necessat-ies for food: their merciful God and Father, there-
fore, took care of them, shortening the time of their misery,
and cutting off the reprobates with a speedier destruction;
lest, if their stroke had been longer continued, the elect
should too far have partaken of their misery.
