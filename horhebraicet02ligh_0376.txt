370 Hebrew and Talmudz'cal [Oh. xxvii. 51.

the Fathers of the Traditions say concerning this catapetocsm
or veill : “ The wall of the pronaon was five cubits‚ the pro-
naon itself eleven. The wall of the Temple was six, the
Temple forty. ΓΒΡἾΕΞ ΠὮΝ, the τάραξις one cubit, and the
entrance, twenty.'' What taraoeis means, Maimonidesm will
tell you; “ In the first Temple there was a wall one cubit
thick, separating the Holy from the Holy of Holies; but
when they built the second Temple, it was doubted whether
the thickness of that wall should be accounted to belong to
the measure of the Holy, or to the measure of .the Holy of
Holies. Wherefore they made the Holy of¹¹ Holies twenty
cubits complete, and the Holy forty cubits complete3 and
they left a void cubit between the Holy and the Holy of
Holies, but they did not build any wall there in the second
Temple: only they made two hangings, one contiguous to
the Holy of Holies, and the other to the Holy; between
which there was a void cubit, according to the thickness of
the wall that was in the first Temple; in which there was but
one catapetasm [or veil] only.”

‘⁶ Theo high priest [on the day of atonement] goes forward
in the Temple, till he comes to the two hangings that divide
the Holy from the Holy of Holies, between which there was a
cubit. R. ,J osi saith, There was but one hanging there3 as it
is said, ‘ And the hanging shall separate [to, or] between the
Holy and the Holy of Holies.'” On which words thus the
Gemara of Babyloni> : “ R. J osi saith rightly to the Rabbins,
and the Rabbins to thee: for he speaks of the tabernacle‚
and they, of the second Temple; in which since there was
not a partition-wall‚ as there was in the first Temple, there
was some doubt made of its holiness, namely, whether it should
belong to the outward part of the Temple or to the inward;
whereupon they made two hangings.'’

While, therefore, their minds were troubled about this
affair, not knowing whether they should hang the veil at the
Temple, 01· at the inmost recess of it, and whether the void
space between of a cubit thick should belong to this or that;
they called the place itself by the Greek word τάραξις, that is,
