length felli> upon their own heads3 and that by the hand and
justice of Grod directing it: for although they out of pride
and contempt fixed that disgraceful name upon the Gentiles,
according to their very just desert, the Holy Spirit recoiled it
upon themselves. See Psal. lix. 6; Phil. iii. 23 Rev. xxii.

Ver. 36<i : Εὐχαριστήσας ἔκλεισε· He [yave tkaozks and Maka]
See here the tract Ber-amm, where it is discoursed of the
