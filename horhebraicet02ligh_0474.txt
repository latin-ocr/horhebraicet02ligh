went not into the judgment hall lest they might be polluted,
but that they might eat the passover;'' pointing with his
finger to the Chaaiaah, and not to the lamb, eaten indeed the
day before.

The word passorer might sound to the same sense in those
words of his also, “It was the preparation of the passover, and
about the sixth hour.’' It was the preparation to the Cliayiyah,
and not to the lamb. But Ι suspect something more may
be understood; namely, that on that day both food was pre-
pared, and the mind too for the niirth of the whole feast. So
that the passover denotes τὴν ἑορτὴν, the feast, not this or that
particular appendage to the feast. The burnt sacrifices which
were offered in the appearance, ΠἾΞἈῙἹ ‚7513 they all became
Gor& as the masters say truly3 aud he who offered them
carried not back the least part of them with him. But the
sacrifices of the Clzayiyale, whether they were oxen or sheep,
the greatest part of them returned to them that offered them 3
and with them they and their friends made solemn and joyful
feastings while they tarried at Jerusalem. So that the oblation
of these on the first day of the feast was παρασκευὴ τοῦ πάσχα,
the preparation of the passooer, and παρασκευὴ τῆς Πευτηκοστῆς,
the preparation of Pentecost, aud παρασκευὴ τῆς Σκηνοπηγίας, tlte
preparation of the fhast of Tabernacles: that is, the day and
manner of preparing food for the following mirth of the feast.
In the same sense was παρασκευὴ, the preparation of the sabbath,
namely, tlte preparation of food and things necessary to the
sabbath. Os which we shall speak at ver. 42.

Haviug thus despatched these thingS, let us now come to
the honr itself. “ It was the preparation of the passover (saith
J ohn),and about the sixth hour,'’ when Pilate delivered Christ
to be crucified. “And it was the third hour (saith Mark)‚
and they crucified him.''

It is disputed by the Gemaristsy, how far the evidences of
two men may agree and consent, whereof one saith, “This
I saw done in that hour ς’ and the other saith, ‘ Ι saw it done
another hom-,³ “One saith, the second hour; another, the
third: ΠὮἾῬ {ru-137 their testimony consists toyether. One
