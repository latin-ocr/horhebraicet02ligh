old, and I resolved to make trial of the institution of the three
seets among us, the Pharisees, the Sadduoees, and the Essenes3
for I judged Ι should be able very well to ehoose the best of
them, if I thoroughly learned them all. Affiicting, therefore,
and much tormenting myself, Ι tried thern all. Καὶ μηδὲ τὴν

with mys-eff that it was not ehouyh to have tried these sects, and
hearing of one Banus, that lived in the wilderness, that he
used a gal-ment ἀπὸ δένδρων made of leaves, or the harh of trees,
and no food but what grew of its own accord, and often by
day and by night washing himself in cold water, I became a
follower of him, and for three years abode with him.’'

And in that plaee in the Talmudists, which we but now
produced, at that very story of Rabh Ketina, wearing a sin-
don in the winter for his talith, we have these words; “ The
religious in elder times, when they had wove three wings [of
the calithJ, they joined nssnn the purple,'' whereof the fringes
were made: “but otherwise, mrtem& ἾἾῸΠΌἻ ΒἾἼἿΒΠ
they are reli9i0u3 who impose upon themselves things heavier them
ordinary.’' And immediately follows the story of the angel
and Ketina, who did so. There were some who heaped up
upon themselves burdens and yokes of religion above the
common rule, and that this is to be understood by ἾἾΥΞΠΌ
ἾΠἾἺΠΞΠΒ such as laid upon themselves heavier thinys than ordi-
nary, both the practice of some Jews persuade, and the word
itself speaks it, being used by the Gemarists in the same sense
elsewhere.

Such, we suppose, was this ιἰχοιιηρ mah (as Josephus was,
when a young man, of whom before), who, when others armed
themselves against the eold with a double garment, namely,
,75³er an ἐπῆεν yarment, and ΠἿῖἳτΔ a talith or eloah, clothed
himself with a single garment, and that of sindon or limen, and
under the show of some more austere religion, neglecting the
ordinary oustom and care of himself.

The thing, taken in the sense which we propound, speaks
the furious madness of this most wioked rout so much the
more, inasmueh as they spared not a man, and him α youny
man, bearing most evident marks of a more severe religion.
