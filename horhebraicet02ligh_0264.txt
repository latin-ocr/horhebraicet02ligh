258 Hebrew ane Ταιηιαιιιοαι ’ [ch. xviii. 19, 20.

Thisd power was built upon that noble and most self-suffi-
cient foundation, John xvi. 13, “ The Spirit of truth shall lead
you into all truth.'' There lies an emphasis in those⁴ words,
“into all truth.'' I deny that any one, any where, at any
time, was led, or to be led, into all truth, from the ascension
of Christ, unto the world's end, beside the apostles. Every
holy man, certainly, is led into all truth necessary to him for
salvation: but the apostles were led into all truth necessary
both for themselves and the whole church; because they were
to deliver a rule of saith and manners to the whole church
throughout all ages, Hence, whatsoever they should confirm
in the law was to be confirmed3 whatsoever they should
abolish was to be abolished: since they were endowed‚ as to
all things, with a spirit of infallibility, guiding them by the
hand into all truth.

Ver. 19: ’Ότι ἐὰν δύο ὑμῶν συμφωνήσωσιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, &c.
lect {f two ofyou shall ayree upon earth, &ej And these words
do closely agree with those that went before: there the speech
was concerning the apostles' determination in all things re-
specting men3 here, concerning their grace and power of
obtaining things from God.

I. Δύο ὑμῶν· Two of yma] Hence Peter and John act
jointly together among the J eWS‚ Acts ii, iii, &Q and they
act jointly among the Samaritam, Acts viii. 143 and Paul
and Barnabas among the Gentiles, Acts xiii. 2. This bond
being broke by Barnabas, the Spirit is doubled as it were
upon Paul.

ΙΙ. Συμφωνήσωσι· Ayree toyetlzer] That is, to obtain some-
thing from Grod ; which appears also from the following words,
οὗ ἐὰν αἰτήσωνται, touchinq any thinq that they shall ask .· sup-
pose, concerning conferring the Spirit by the imposition of
hands, of doing this or that miracle, διο.

Ver. 20: Οὗ γάρ εἶσι δύο ἢ τρεῖς συνηγμένοι εἷς τὸ ἐμὸν
ὄνομα, ἐκεῖ εἰμὶ ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν· For where two or three are
yatlcered toyetker in my name, there am I in the midst os them]
The like do the Rabbins speak of two or three sitting in
judgment, that ΠΞΌἪ the divine presence is in the midst of
them.
