Ch. yiii. 6, 12.] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 163

Secondly, He would have him restored to the communion
of the church (from which his leprosy had separated him),
after the wonted and instituted manner. He provides that
he himself give no scandal, and the person healed make no
schism: and however both his words and gestures sufficiently
argue tha-t he believed in Christ, yet Christ will by no means
draw him from the communion of the church, but restore him
to it. Hence is that command of his to him 3 ‘⁶ See thou tell
no man, but offer a gift for a testimony to them :⁵³ that is,
‘ Do not boast the extraordinary manner of thy healing3

certainly most- just judgment, concerning thy eternal blind-
ness and perdition. For whatsoever τὸ σκότος τὸ ἐξώτερον,
outer darkness, signifies, whether tke darkness of the keatken
(for to the Jews the heathen were οἱ ἔξω, those that are
without), or that darkness beyond that, Isaiah ix. Ι, or both;
our Saviour clearly intimates the Jews were thither to be
banished3 but that they were to be recalled again, he inti-
mates not anywhere: if so be by υἱοὺς βασιλείας, ckz'ldren of
