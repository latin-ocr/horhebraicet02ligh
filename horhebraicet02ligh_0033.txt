Ch. ii. 1.] Emeroitations upon St. Matchew. 27

The Temple was building 7 years, 1 Kings vi. 38. Casting
up, therefore, all these together, viz.
1656
427

430
480

7

The sum of years amounts to 3000

 

And it is clear, the building of the Temple was finished and
completed in the year of the world 3000.

The Temple was finished in the eleventh year of Solomon,
1 Kings vi. 38 : and thence to the revolting of the ten tribes,
in the first year of Rehoboam, were 30 years. Therefore,
that revolt was in the year of the world 3030.

Fromk the revolt of the ten tribes to the destruction of
Jerusalem under Zedekiah were three hundred and ninety
years: which appears sufficiently from the chronical com-
putation of the parallel times of the kings of Judah and
Israel: and which is implied by Ezekiel, iv. 4-6 : ‘⁶ Thoul shalt
sleep upon thy left side, and shalt put the iniquities of the
house of Israel upon it, &a according to the number of the
days, three hundred and ninety days. And when thou shalt
have accomplished them, thou shalt sleep upon thy right side
the second time, and shalt take upon thee the iniquity of
the house of J udah forty days Concerning the computation
of these years, it is doubted, whether those forty years are to
be numbered together within the three hundred and ninety
years, or by themselves, as following after those three hun-
dred and ninety years. We, not without cause, embrace the
former opinion, and suppose those forty years to be included
within the sum of three hundred and ninety ; but mentioned
by themselves particularly, for a particular reason. For by
the space of forty years before the destruction of the city by
the Chaldeans, did Jeremiah prophesy daily, namely, from
the third year of J osias to the sacking of the city: whom the
people not hearkening to, they are marked for that peculiar
iniquity with this note.
