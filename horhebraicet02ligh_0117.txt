the Sanhedrim. But he that hires another by a reward to
kill his neighbour, or who sends his servants, and they kill
him; or he that thrusts him violently upon a lion, or upon
some other beast, and the beast kill him; 01· he that kills
himself, ΕἿὩἾ ’ῘΞἾΨ ἾΚῬΝὈ ἼΠΝ ³7: every one of these is a
shedder of blood, and the iniquity of manslaughter is in his
hand, and he is liable to death iffimfflvs by the hand of God ‚·
but he is not to be punished with death by the Sanhedrim.''

Behold a double manslayer! Behold a double judgment!
Now let the words of our Saviour be applied to this Gloss of
the ancients upon the law of murder: “ Do ye hear‚” saith
he, ‘⁶ what is said by the ancients, VVhosoever shall kill, after
what manner soever a man shall kill him, whether by the
hand of one that he hath hired, or by his servants, or by set-
ting a beast on him; he is guilty of the judgment of God,
though not of the judgment of the Sanhedrim: and whose-
ever shall kill his neighbour by himself, none other inter-
posing, this man is liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrim:
but I say unto you, That whosoever is rashly angry with his
brother, this man is liable to the judgment of God3 and
whosoever shall say to his brother, Raea, he is liable to the
Sanhedrim.'7

These words of our Saviour‚ perhaps, we shall more truly
understand a by comparing some more phrases and doctrines,
very usual in the J ewish sohools. Such as these, ὊἾἾΌ ἾἾζοΞ
