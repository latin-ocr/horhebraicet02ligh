for the Saviour, which the name Jesus signifies; but alm,
that J esus might be pointed out for true Christ.- against the
unbelief of the Jews, who though they acknowledged a cer-
tain Messiah, or Christ, yet they stiffly denied that Jesus of
Nazareth was he. This observation takes place in numberless
places of the New Testament; Acts ii. 36, viii. 3 53 1 Cor.
xvi. 223 1 John ii. 22, iv. 15, &c.

Ὑὶοῦ Δαβίδ· The Son of David] That is, ‘⁶ the true Mes-
sias.” For by, no more ordinary and more proper name did
the Jewish nation point out the Messiah than by ἻἹἺ Ρ
Tlce Son of David. See Matt. xii. 23, xxi. 9, xxii. 423 Luke
xviii. 383 and everywhere in the Talmudic writings‚ buti
especially in Bab. Sanhedrimk: where it is also discussed,
What kind of times those should be when the Son of David
should come.

The things which are devised by the -Jews concerning Mes-
siah Ben J oseph (which the Targum upon Cant. iv. 5 calls
‘ Messiah Ben Ephraim') are therefore devised, to comply
with their giddiness and loss of judgment in their opinion of
the Messiah. For, since they despised the true Messiah‚
who came in the time fore-allotted by the prophets‚ and cru-
cified hi1n; they still expect I know not what chimerical one,
concerning whom they have no certain opinion: whether
he shall be one, or two; whether he shall arise from among
the living, or from the dead; whether he shall come in the
clouds of heaven, or sitting upon an ass, &cz they expect a
Son of David,· but they know not whom, they know not
when.
