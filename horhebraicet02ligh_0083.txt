Ch. iii. 7.] Eoeercitations upon St. Mattkew. 77

XVhen I fetoh the rise of the Sadducees not much after
the death of Simeon the Just, that does not unseasonably
come into my mind, which is mentioned by the Talmudists,
that the state of things became worse after his death. ‘⁶ Allo
the days of Simeon the Just, the scape-goat had soaroe come
to the middle of the precipice of the mountain [whence he
was east down]‚ but he was broken into pieces: but, when
Simeon the Just was dead, he fied away [alive] into the
desert, and was eaten by Saracens. While Simeon the Just
lived, the lot of God [in the day of expiation] went forth
always to the right hand: Simeon the Just being dead, it
went forth sometimes to the right hand and sometimes to
the left. All the days of Simeon the Just, the little searlet
tongue looked always white; but when Simeon the Just was
dead, it sometimes looked white and sometimes red. All
the days of Simeon the Just, the west light always burnt 3
but when he was dead, it sometimes burnt and sometimes
went out. All the days of Simeon the Just, the fire upon
the altar burnt clear and bright ς and, after two pieces of
wood laid on in the morning, they laid on nothing else the
whole day: but- when he was dead, the force of the fire
languished in that manner that they were compelled to sup-
ply it all the day. All the days of Simeon the Just, a bless-
ing was sent upon the two loaves and the show-bread, so
that a portion came to every priest, to the quantity of an
olive at least; and there were some who ate till they were
satisfied‚ and there were others to whom something re-
mained after they had eaten their fill : but when Simeon the
Just was dead, that blessing was withdraw, and so little
remained to each, that those that were modest withdrew
their hands, and those that were greedy still stretohed them
out.''
