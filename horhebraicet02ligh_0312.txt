of J eberechiah, the Jews have these thingsi: “ It is written,
‘I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
priest, and Zechariah the son of Barachiah,’ [irs-³:52 writ
without Jod prefixed,] Isa. viii. 1. But what is the reason
that Uriah is joined with Zechariah? for Uriah was under
the first Temple3 Zechariah under the second: but the Scrip-
ture joineth the prophecy of Zechariah to the prophecy of
Uriah. By Urias it is written, ‘ For your sakes Sion shall
be ploughed as a field) By Zechariah it is written, ‘ As
yet old men and ancient women shall sit in the streets of
Jerusalem) W'hen the prophecy of Uriah is fulfilled‚ the
prophecy of Zechariah shall also be fulfilled.” Το the same
sense also speaks the Chaldee paraphrast upon the place:
“ ⁶ And Ι took unto me faithful witnesses.' The curses which
I foretold I would bring, in the prophecy of Uriah the priest,
behold they are come to pass: likewise all the blessings which
I foretold I would bring, in the prophecy of Zechariah the
son of J eberechiah‚ I will bring to pass.'' See also there

tion‚ why might not our Saviour have the same liberty to call
BaraclziaS the father of Zacharia& as the Chaldee paraphrast
had to call him Icldo ,9 2. It is plain that the Jews looked
upon those words of Isaiah as the words of God speaking to
Isaiah, not of Isaiah relating a matter of fact historically;
which, indeed, they conjecture very truly and exactly ac-
cording to the printing of the first word HTyzffl for the
conjunction Vazo, being pointed with Sheva, it is ἐι certain
token that the verb is to be renderedk in the future tense,
not in the preter3 which also the Interlineary Version .
hath well observed, rendering it thus, Et testzfloari faciam
milei testes fideles, And I will make faithful witness-es testzf‘q
to me.

For if it had been to be construed in the preter tense, it
should have been pointed by Kamets9 ΠἾᾨξὶ] Et testificari

feci, And I caused to witness. Which being well observed,
