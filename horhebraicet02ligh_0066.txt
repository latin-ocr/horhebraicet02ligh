is, it is required, that three men, who are scholars of the wise
men, be present at the baptism of a proselyte; who may take
care that the business be rightly performed, and may briefly
instruct the catechumen [the person to be baptized], and may
judge of the matter itself. For the admission of a prose-

hath the gonorrhoea is cleansed nowhere but in a fountain:
but a menstruous woman, as also all other unclean persons,
were washed in some confluence of waters3 in which so much
water ought to be as may serve to wash the whole body at
one dipping. Our wise men have esteemed this proportion to
be a cubit square, and three cubits depth: and this measure
contains sorty seahs of water.”
