276 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxi. 15.

the half shekel, a kolbon [or the fee that was paid to the
money-changer] was half a mea, that is, the twelsth part of a
penny, and never less, But the kolbons were not like the
half shekeh but the exchangers laid them by themselves till
the holy treasury were paid out of them.'' You see what these
moneychanyers were, and whence they had their name. You
see that Christ did not overturn the chests in which the holy
money was laid up, but the tables on which they t-rafficked
for this unholy gain.

Τῶν πωλούντων τὰς περιστεράς· Of those that sold doves]
0³:³¹7 ’133373 sellers of doves. See the Talmudic treatise of
that title. :arn *ew-m n‘vsz: :rev τηου “ Dovesy
were at one time sold at Jerusalem for peuce of ¹qold. Where-
upon Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel said, ΠῖιἾ 'Nym-l By this
temple, I will not lie down this night, unless they be sold for
pence of silver, 810. Going into the comen-house, he thus
decreed, A woman of five undoubted labours‚ or of five un-
doubted fluxes, shall be bound only to make one offering;
whereby doves were sold that very day for two sarthings.''
The offering for women after childbirth, and fluxes, for their
purification, were pigeons2, &c. But now, when they went up
to Jerusalem with their offerings at the feasts only, there was
at that time a greater number of beasts, pigeons‚ and turtles‚
&c. requisite. See what we have said at the fifth chapter, and
the three-and-twentieth verse.

lee children cryiny in the temple, cmd saffira-q, Hosamm]
O'lcildren, from their first infancy, were taught to manage the
bundles, to shake them, and in shaking‚ to sing Hosanna.

how to wave the handle, is bound to carry α handle. W’here the
Gemara saith thus; ‘· The Rabbins teach, that so soon as a
little child can be taught to manage a bundle, he is bound to
carry one : so soon as he knows how to veil himself, he must
put on the borders: as soon as he knows how to keep his
father's phylacteries‚ he must put on his own : as soon as he
can speak, let his father teach him the law, and to say the
phylacteries,” &c.
