300 Hebrew and Talmudical [Oh. xxiii. 28.

R. Samuel Bar Nachman, allegeth that of Ezekie1113 “ If one
passing through the land seeth a man's bone, he shall set up
a burial sign by it0.’'

The Glossers deliver both the reason and the manner of
it thus: “ From the fifteenth day of the month Adar they
began their sear0h; and wheresoever they found a sepulchre
whose whiting was washed off with the rain, they renewed
it, that the unclean place might be discerned‚ and the priests
who were to eat the Trumala might avoid it.'' Gloss on
Shekalim, and again on Blaesar Shenz': ‘⁶ They marked the
sepulehres with chalk in the likeness of bones; and mixing
it with water, they washed the sepulchre all about with it,
that thereby all might know that the place was unclean,
and therefore? to be avoided.” Ooneerning this matter also,
the Glossq speaks; “ They made marks like bones .on the
sepulehres with white chalk‚'’ 810. See the place.
