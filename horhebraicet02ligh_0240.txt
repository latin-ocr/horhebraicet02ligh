and the other disciples whom he had gathered, and were very
many, acknowledged him the Messias ε yea, those blind men,
chap. ix. 27, had confessed this also : therefore that question
had been needless as to them, “ Do they think me to be the
Messias ?⁷’ but that was needful, ‘⁶ What do they conceive of
me, the Messias ?'' and to this the answer of Peter has
regard, “ Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God :³⁹ as if
he should say, “ We knew well enough a good while ago that
thou art the Messias ; but as to the question, ‘ What kind of
person thou art: I say, ‘ Thou art the Son of the living God.' ''

raised from the dead, should be the Messias.) And this
perhaps persuaded them furt-her, because they thought that
the kingdom of the Messias should arise after the resurrec-
tion: and they that were of this opinion might be led to
