011.v. 3 ι .] Exercitations upon St. Matthew. 119

Niddah, fol. 13, quite through. Among other things, R.
Tarphon saith, “Whosoever brings his hand to his modest
parts, let his hand be cut off unto his navel.’' And a little
after3 “ It is better that his belly should be cleft in two: than
that he should descend into the well of corruption.'’ The
discourse is of moving the hand to the privy member, thatl,
by the handling it, it might be known whether the party had
the gonorrhoea, or no : and m yet they adjudge never so little
handling it to cutting off the hand. Read the place, if you
have leisure.

Ver. 31: ΔΟς ἂν ἀπολύσῃ τὴν γυναῖκα, δότω αὐτῇ ἀποστά-

Among the chapters of Talmudical doctrine, we meet with
none concerning which it is treated more largely‚ and more
to a punctilio, than of divorces: and yet there the chief care
is not so much of a just cause of it as of the manner and form
of doing it. To him that turns over the book Gittz'n (as also,
indeed, the whole Seder Nashim, that part of the Talmud
that treats of women), the diligence of the Masters about
this matter will appear such that they seem to have dwelt,
not without some complacency, upon this article above all
others.

God, indeed, granted to that nation a law concerning di-
vorces, Deut. xxiv. 1, permitte-d only “for the hardness of
their hearts,'' Matt. xix, 8: in which permission‚ neverthe-
less, they boast, as though it were indulged thern by mere
privilege. When Grod had established that fatal law of pu-
nishing adultery by death (Deut. xxii.), for the terror of
the people, and for their avoiding of that sin ; the same mer-
