third part of the niylct. Thus the Gloss upon the place now
cited. See also the Hebrew commentators upon J udg. vii. 19.
Not that they divided not the night into four parts, but that
they esteemed the fourth part, or the watch, not so much for
the night as for the morning. So Mark xiii. 3 5, that space
after cockcrowing is called πρωῒ, the morniny. See also
Exod. xiV. 24. There were, therefore, in truth‚ four watches
of the night, but only three of deep night. When, therefore,
it is said that Gideon set upon the Midianitcs in the “ middle
watch of the night,qq J udg. vii. 19, it is to be understood of
that watch which was indeed the second of the whole night,
but the middle watch of the deep night: namely, from the
ending of the first watch to midnight.

do they transffl·ess the tradition of tlte elders .9] How great a
value they set upon their traditions, even above the word of
God, appears sufficiently from this very place, ver. 6. Out of
infinite examples which we meet with in their writings, we

gressing the words of the law‚' is not guilty3 but he that shall
say, ‘There are five Totapkoth, adding to the words of the
scribes? he is guilty.’'

‘⁵ A prophet and πρεσβύτερος an elder, to what are they
likened3 To a king sending two of his servants into a pro-
vince. Of one he writes thus, ‘ Unless he shew you my seal,

not my seal, yet believe him.’ Thus it is written of the pro-
phet, ‘ He shall shew thee a sign or a miracle3’ but of the
elders.thus, ‘ According to the law which they shall teach
thee‚''’ &c But enough of blasphemies.
