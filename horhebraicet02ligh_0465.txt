mer especially, and iu Jerusalem for the most part, made of
sindon or of limen. And the question between the schools of
Shammai and Hillel arose hence, that when the fringes were
woollen, and the cloak linen, how would the suspicion of wear-
ing things of different sorts be avoided? U'J’WDL) &7³³ ’Ἶ &nm
R. Zeira- loosed his sindon. The Gloss is: “ He loosed his
fringes from his sindon [that is, from his talida, which was
of ‘sindonj linem} because it was of linen‚” διο. “ Theb angel
found Rabh Ketina 81]*Ἳο ὊΞἻΞἾ clotked in sisndoom and
said to him, Ο Ketina, Ketina, &105'572 &2⁸70 sindon in the
summer, &is-vm &³7:505 and α skort cloak in the winter.

You see that word which is spoke by the evangelist, ἐπὶ
γυμνοῦ, about his naked body, carries an emphasis: for it was
most usual to be clothed with sindon for an outer garment.
What therefore must we say of this young man? I suppose in
the first place, that he was not a disciple of J esus; but that
he now followed, as some curicus looker on, to 866 what this
multitude would at last produce. And to such a suspicion
they certainly do consent, who think him to have been roused
from his bed, and hastily followed the rout with nothing but
his shirt on, without any other 61011168. Ι suppose, secondly,
St. Mark in the phrase περιβεβλημένος σινδόνα baviny α sindon
cast about him, spake according to the known and vulgar
dialect of the nation‚ &3³50 *02³3 or ΓἻΟ rimi-2⁷2 olotked
with a sindon. For none shall ever persuade me that he would
use an idiom, any thing uncouth or strange to the nati0n;
and that when 116 used the very same phrase in Greek with
that J ewish one, he intended not to propound the very same
sense. But now you clearly see, they themselves being our
teachers, what is the meaning of being] clotked with a sindon,
with them, namely, to have a talith or cloalc made of linem,-
that garment to which the fringes hung. Ι suppose, in the
last place, that this young man, out of religion, or superstition
rather, more than ordinary, had put on his sindon, and nothing
but that upon his naked body, neglecting his inner garment
(commonly called ‚75171'1 chalulc), and indeed neglecting his
body. For there were some amongst the Jews that did so
macerate their bodies, and afflict 1116111 with hunger and cold,
oven above the severe rule of other sects.
