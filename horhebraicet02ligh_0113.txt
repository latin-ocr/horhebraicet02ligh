Ch. v. 21, 22.] Emercz'tations upon St. Matthew. 107

were compacted from the comparing of the two copies of the
greatest authority, that is, the Jewish and the Babylonian:
which when they differed from one another in so many places
in certain little dashes of writing‚ but little or nothing at all
as to the sense, by very sound counsel they provided that
both should be reserved, so that both copies might have their
worth preserved, and the sacred text its purity and fulness,
whilst not one jot nor one tittle, of it perished.

Ver. 2] : Ἠκούσατε· Y e leave heard] That is, ye have re-
ceived it by tradition. &1³7 Tm& 537an DN Ifl they have
heard [that is, learned by tradition] they spealc to them. ⁵²20
ἾἾὮῙὮ ΠΏἾὩΨΠ They learned by keariny, that is, by tradition;
a saying very frequent in Maimonides.

‘'Ort. ἐρρέθη τοῖς ἀρχαίοις· T hat it was said by them qfold tima]
That is, “it is an old tradition.’' For the particular passages
of the law which are here cited by our Saviour are not pro-
duced as the bare words of Moses, but as clothed in the
Glosses of the Scribes; which most plainly appears above the
rest, ver. 43, and sufficiently in this first allegation, where
those words, “ VVhosoever shall kill shall be guilty of the
judgment,'' do hold out the false paint of tradition, and, as
we observe in the following verses, such as misrepresents the
laW‚ and makes it of none effect. If it be asked‚ why Christ
makes mention of ‘⁶ those of old time 3³³ it may be answered,
that the memory of the ancienter Fathers of the Traditions
was venerable among the people. Reverend was the name
ΠἾἾΨΝἾ &vm-1 of thefirst qood men, and {2³:51an ΒὊΞΠ
the first wisa men. Therefore Christ chose to confute their
doctrines and Glosses, that he might more clearly prove the
vanity of traditions, when he reproved their most famous men.
But the sense which we have produced is plain, and without
any difficulty3 as if he should say, “It is an old, tradition
which bath obtained for many ages.”

Ver. 22: Ἐγὼ δὲ λέγω ὑμῖν· But I say unco you] ’ΞΝἸ
2 ἾῩΞἸΝ But I say, the words of one that refutes or determines
a question, very frequently to be met with in the Hebrew
writers. To this you may lay that os Isaiah, chap. ii. 3, “ And
he will teach us of his ways,” &a WVhere Kimchi writes thus,
