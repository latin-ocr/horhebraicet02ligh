But now, when prophecies were spoken only in the Hebrew
language, however they understoodZ the sense of the words,
yet they reputed it not for a prophecy, because it was not
uttered in the language that was proper foi· prophetical pre-
dictions. But we tarry not here. That which we would
have is this, that Matthew wrote not in Hebrew (which is
proved sufficiently by what is spoken before), if so be we
suppose him to have written in a language vulgarly known
and understood; which, certainly, we ought to suppose:
not that he, or the other writers of the New Testament,
wrote in the Syriae language, unless we suppose them to have
written in the ungrateful language of an ungrateful nation,
which, certainly, we ought not to suppose. For when the
Jewish people were now to be cast off, and to be doomed to
eternal cursing, it was very improper, certainly, to extol
their language, whether it were the Syriae mother-tongue,
or the Chaldee, its cousin language, unto that degree of
honour3 that it should be the original language of the New
Testament. Improper, certainly, it was, to write the Grospel
in their tonguc, who, above all the inhabitants of the world,
most despised and opposed it.

New Testament was written very congruously in the Gentile
language, and in that which, among the Gentile languages,
was the most noble; viz. the Greek. Let us see what the
Jews say of this language, envious enough against all lan-
guages besides their own.

“ Rabban Simeona Ben Gamaliel saith, Even concerning
the holy books, the wise men permitted not that they should
be written in any other language than Greek. R. Abhu saith
that R. J ochanan said, The tradition is according to Rabban
Simeon; that R. J ochanan said, moreover, Whence is that of
Rabban Simeon proved? From thence, that the Scripture
saith, ‘The Lord shall persuade Japhet, and he shall dwell
in the tents of Sem τ’ the words of Japhet shall be in the
