kim lais fault between thee (md him alona] The reason of the
precept is founded in that charitable law, Levit. xix, 173
“Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart3 but thou
shalt surely reprove him, and shalt not suffer sin in him.''

Here the Talmudists speak not amiss: “ Them Rabbins
deliver, ‘ Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart.' Per-
haps he does not beat him, he does not pull off his hair,
he does not curse him: the text saith, ‘in thy heart‚' speak-

not, let him bring others, and let him appense him before
them. If perhaps he die, let him appease him at his sepul-
chre, and· say, I have sinned against thee? ”

But our Saviour here requires a higher chat-ity3 namely,
from him who is the offended party. In like manner, “ 'Phe ι)
great Sanhedrim admonished a city lapsed to idols, by two
disciples of the wise men. If they repented, well: if not,
