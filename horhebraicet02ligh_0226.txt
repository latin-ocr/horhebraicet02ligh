was our opinion once also with them : but at last we learned
of J osephus, that Bethsaida was ἐν τῇ ἄνω Γαυλανιτικῇ, in tlte
upper Gaulanitis, (which we observe elsewhere,) on the east
coast of the sea of Gennesaret in Perea.

Ἠκολούθησαυ αὐτῷ πεζῇ· They followed kim on foot.] From
hence interpreters argue that Capernaum and Bethsaida lay
not on different shores of the sea, but on the same : for how
else, say they, could the multitude follow him afoot? Very
well, say I, passing Jordan near Tiberias, whose situation I
have elsewhere shewn to be at the efflux of Jordan out of the
sea of Galilee. They followed him afoot ἀπὸ τῶν πόλεων,
fi‘om the citios, saith our evangelist : now there were cities of
some note very near Oapernaum, Tarichea on one side, Tibe-
rias on the other. Let it be granted that the multitude
travelled out of these cities after Christ3 the way by which
they went afoot was at the bridge of Jordan in Ghammath:
that place was distant a mile or something less from Tiberias,
and from Oapernaum three miles or thereabouts. Passing
Jordan, they went along by the coast of Magdala; and, after
that, through the country of Hippo: now Magdala was dis-
tant one mile from Jordan, Hippo two; and after Hippo
was Bethsaida, at the east shore of the sea3 and after Beth-
saida was a bay of the sea, thrusting out itself somewhat into
the land3 and from thence was the desert of Bethsaida.
Nthn, thereforess, they returned back from thence, he com-
mands his disciples to get into a ship, and to go to Bethsaida,
while he sent the multitude away, whence he would afterward
follow them on foot, and would sail with them thence to
Gapernaum.
