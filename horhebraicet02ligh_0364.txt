testify that N. killed N. They say to them, How do you
depose this, when the killer, or he that was killed, was with us
in such a place on that day? These as yet are not {mm}-
Butk if they should say, How can you testify this when you
were with us on that day ¹ ἓ” &c. On which Misna‚ thus Mai-
1nonides; “ The witnesses depose that Reuben killed Simeon:
and afterward Kohath and Hushim come, mum and dis-
prove their testimony: there come afterward other witnesseS,
and depose the same with the for1ner3 namely, that Reuben
killed Simeon3 and Kohath and Hushim disprove their tes-
timony also: if a second, third, and fourth, nay, if a thou-
sand pair ¹¹¹ corne and depose the same thing, while those two
so disprove them, they must all die by the testimony of these
two‚⁵' 830.

There was the like testimony in other things: thus in the
first halae-ala of the chapter quoted3 DWURJJ nrm-1 72³:
ΓὮΌἾῘ “How are witness-es made ΒἾὉΌὊΞ We testify con-
cerning N.‚ that he is the son of a divorced woman, &c. They
do not say, Let this witness [if he prove false] be made the
son of a divorced woman instead of the other, but he is
beaten with sorty stripes.'' The words are obscure enough,
but their meaning is this: Since a false witness was by the
law to suffer the same things which, by his perjury, he had
designed to bring upon another, it is here inquired, in what·
cases a witness is so far to be accounted false as to undergo
such a retaliation3 And it is answered, Not in all: and this
reason is alleged, If any one, by false witness, should en-
deavour to deprive another of his legitimacy, and, by conse-
quence of the privileges of being legitimate‚ by saying that
he is the son of a divorced woman, though he were indeed
072·st 79 a false witness, yet he must not be punished in the
like kind, to be made as the son of a divorced woman3 but
he must be whipped. But in capital cases the custom was,
that whosoever endeavoured to procure death to another per-
son by false witness, must himself be put to death.
