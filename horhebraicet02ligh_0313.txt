Oh. xxiii. 3 5.] Exercitations upon St. Mastlaew. 307

. eulty under our hand is resolved, as I imagine, very clearly:
and I suppose that Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah in
Isaiah is the very same with our Zacharias the son of Je-
hoiada; and that the sense of Isaiah comes to this: in that
and the foregoing chapterl there is a diseourse of the future
destruction of Damascus, Samaria, and Judea. For a eon-
firmation of the truth of this propheoy‚ God makes use of a
double testimony: first, he commands the prophet Isaiah to
write, over and over again, in a* great volume, from the
beginning to the end, “ Le maher shalal hash baz :⁵³ that is,
“ To hasten the spoil, he hastened the preyz'⁵ and this volume
should be an undoubted testimony to them, that God would
certainly bring on and hasten the forementioned spoiling and
destruction. “And moreover (saith God), I will raise up to
myself two faithful martyrs,'' (or witnesses‚) who shall testify
and seal the same thing with their words and with their
blood, namely, Uriah the priest‚ who shall hereafter be
orowned with martyrdom for this very thing, J er. xxvi. 20,
23, and Zeehariah the son of Barachiah, or J ehoiada, who is
lately already crowned: he, the first martyr under the first
Temple; mis, the last. Hear, thou JeW‚ who taxest Mat-
thew in this place: your own authors asser-t, that Uriah the
priest is to be understood by that Uriah who was killed by
J ehoiakim 3 and that truly. We also assert, that Zeehariah
the son of Jehoiadah is to be understood by Zeehariah the
son of J ebereehiah3 and that Matthew and Christ do not at
all innovate in this name of Barachias, but did only pronounce
the same things concerning the father of the martyr Zacha-
rias, which God himself had pronounced beforem them by the
prophet Isaiah.

Objection. But since our Saviour took examples from the
Old Testament, why did he not rather say, “from the blood
of Abel to the blood of Uriah the priest 3’' that is, from the
beginning of the world to the end of the first Temple? I
answer‚

1. The killing of Zeehariah was more horrible‚ as he was
more high in dignity; and as the place wherein he was killed
was more holy.
