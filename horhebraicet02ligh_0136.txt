130 Hebrew and Talmudical [Ch. v. 39.

- 111 the mean time, little care was taken of lively charity,
and of the forgiving an offence,—an open door being still
left them to exaction and revenge, which will appear in what
follows:

Ver. 39 : ‘'Ocms σε ῥαπίσει ἐπὶ τὴν δεξιάν σου σιαγόνα· Who-
soever shall smite thee on thy riylct abach] That the doctrine of
Christ may here more clearly shine. out, let the Jewish doc-
trine be set against it; to which he opposeth his.

‘⁶ Doesi any one give his neighbour a box on the ear? let
him give him a shilling. R. ,Judah in the name of R. J osi of
Galilee saith, Let him give him a pound.“'

ΤΠ Omma 337 ῙΠἸΞ ἹἾτΔΕ) “ Does he qive him α blow upon
the ebech? Lat him yive him two hundred zuzees .· if with the
other hand, let him give four hundred.” Compare with this
passage ver. 39 : ‘ If any shall strike thee on the right cheek,
turn to him the other also)

pull off his hair; or does he spit, so that his spittle falls upon

pare ver. 40 with it, ‘ He that will take away thy coat‚' &c.];
“ or does he uncover a woman's head in public? Let him give
four: hundred zuzees.''

They fetch the reason of so severe a mulct chiefly from the
shame done him that is thus injured, and from the disgrace
of the thing itself: and, moreover, from the dignity of an
Israelite: which is declared at large by the Cremarists upon
the words cited, and by Maimonides k.

vnn: *22³7 ἶῖῧΠ “ Τ11080 mulcts [say they] are established
and inflicted accordinq to the diynity of the person injured.
But R. Akibah said, ⁶ Even the poorest Israelites are to be
esteemed as though they were persons of quality divested of
their estates, because they are the sons of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob.'''

Hence the entrance to our Saviour’s doctrine lies easy:
1. He cites the law of retaliation, that, by laying one against
the other, Christian charity and forgiveness might shine thel
clearer. 2. He mentions these particulars which seemed to
be the most unworthy, and not to be borne by the high quality
