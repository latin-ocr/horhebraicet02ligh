A Bia of Divorce.

“ On the day of the weck N ., of the mouth of N ., of the year of
the world's creation N ., according to the computation by which we
are wont to reckon in the province N. ,- Ι, N ., the son of N„ and
by what name soever I am called, of the city N„ with the greatest
consent of my mind, and without any compulsion urging me, have
put away, dismissed, and expelled thee ; thee, I g say, N.‚ the
daughter of N„ by what name soever thou art called, of the city
N ., who heretofore wert my wife. But now Ι have dismissed thee,
—thee, I say, N„ the daughter of N„ by what name soever thou
art called, of the city N. So that thou art free, and in thine own
power, to marry whosoever shall please thee 3 and let no man hinder
thee, from this day forward even for ever. Thou art fi'ee, therefore,
for any man. And let this be to thee a bill of rejection from me,
letters of divorce, and a schedule of expulsionb, according to the law
of Moses and Israel.

REUBEN the son of Jacob witness.

ELIEZER the son of Gilead witness.''

nidesi.

V. This bill, being confirmed with the husband's seal, and
the subscription of witnesses, was to be delivered into the hand
of the wife, either by the husband himself, or by some other
deputed by him for this office : or the wife might depute somef
body to receive it in her stead.

VI. It was not to be delivered to the wife, but in the pre-
sence of two, who might read the bill both before it was given
into the hand of the wife and after: and when it was given,
the husband, if present, said thus, “ Behold,-this is a bill of
divorce to you.''
