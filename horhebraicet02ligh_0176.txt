H. It was not seldom that they enjoined themselves fasts,
for this end, to have lucky dreams 3 or to attain the interpre-
tation of some dream3 or to turn away the ill import of a
dream. Hence was that expression very usual, ΕἹῖῖΠ ΠἾΏΠ
Α fast for a drasam· and it was a common proverb, ΠΞἿ

called ΝῶίἳΠ ΟΙιαῖεῘια, that is, The weak. And when the city
was now destroyed, and he saw it was in vain to fast any
longer, he used the physicians of Titus to restore his health,
which, through too much abstffience, had been wasted.
