250 Hebrcw aad Talmud-ical [Ch. xvii. 24.

Ἱεροσολύμοις νεὼν συνετέλουν· “ HeZ laid a tax upon all the
Jews wheresoever they were, namely, two drachms‚· command-
ing every one, of whatever age, to bring it into the Capitol,
as before they had paid it into the Temple at J erusalem.''
And Dion Cassius of the Same thus, Καὶ ἀπ’ ἐκείνου δίδραχμον
ἐτάχθη, Sto. “Hea commanded all to bring the didrachm yearly
to Jupiter Capitolinus.'’

The Seventy Interpreters, indeed, upon Exod. xxx. 13, render
it ἥμισυ τοῦ διδράχμου, staff cc dz'drablmm but adding this more-
over, ὅ ἐστιν κατὰ τὸ δίδραχμον τὸ ἅγιον, which ‘is' according] to
the hely didrachma. Be it so; the whole shekel was δίδραχμον
ἅγιον, the leolps didmchm .· then let the half shekel be, δίδραχμον
δημόσιον, tlec common diclrachm. However, the thing is, he
that paid the half-shekel, in the vulgar dialect, was called,
he tlcczt paid the shekcls; and that which is here said by
Matfflew, δίδραχμα λαμβάνοντες, tlaeps that receive the didraokm,
the Talmudists express, ΞἾῖῬβζΖ] TUNE-3 or ΓΞἹἎ they that
dmmnd or collect the shebels. The Targuinists render that
place, Exod. xxx. [13]‚ &273‘70 DULJD 25]ae half of the skale&
the reason of which see, if you please, in Maimonidesb. “ The
shekel (saith he) concerning which the Law speaks, did weigh
three hundred and twenty grains of barley; but the wise men
sometime added to that weight‚ and made it to be of the same
value with the money '37370 Sela, under the second Temple,
that is, three hundred eighty-four middling grains of barley.'’
See the place and the Gloss.

2. The answer of Christ sufficiently argues that the dis-
course is concerning this tax, when he saith, He is son of that
king for whose use that tribute was demanded: for, “ from
thence were bought the daily and additional sacrifices, and
their drink offerings, the sheaf, the two loaves (Lev. xxiii. 17),
the shewbread, all the sacrifices of the congregation, the red
cow, the scapegoat, and the crimson tongue, which was be-
tween his h01·ns0‚'' 810.

But here this objection occurs, which is not so easy to
answer. Thed time of the payment- of the half shekel was

about the feast of the Passover3 but now that time was far
