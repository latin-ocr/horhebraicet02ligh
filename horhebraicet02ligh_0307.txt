were those sins under the first Temple for which it was
destroyed; and it is answered, “ Idolatry, fornication, and
bloodshed.” They inquire, what were the sins under the
second 3 and answer, ‘⁴ Hate without cause, and secret ini-
quity ;” and add these words, “ To those that were under the
first Temple their end was revealed, because their iniquity
was revealed: mm ubam εἴ) tany ribam ζώω uniaris

iniquity; therefore their end was revealed to them: as it is
said, ⁶ After seventy years I will visit you in Babylon :² but

the man now dead, what shall be done with it; the answer
is, “ Let it be laid up till Elias come : but R. Nathan saith,
ἹἾᾙ ³737 ivm '¹³7 3³:³2 Let them mise some pellar [or build-
iny] upon leis sepulchre.” Which that it was done for the
sake of adorning the sepulchres is proved from the words
