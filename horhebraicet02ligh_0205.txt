Ver. 8: Κύριος γάρ ἐστι καὶτοῦ σαββάτου ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου·
For the Son of mem is Lorcl also of tlze sabbath] I. He op-
posed this very argument against their cavils before the San-
hedrim, John v. YVhen he was summoned into the court
concerning his healing the paralytic man on this very sab-
bath, or on the sabbath next before, he shews his dominion
over the sabbath from this very thing, that he, the Son, was
invested and honoured with the same authority, power, and
dignity, in respect of the administration of the New Testa-
ment, as the Father was in regard of the Old.

II. The care of the sabbath lay upon the first Adam under
a double law, according to his double condition: Ι. Before
his fall, under the law of nature written in his heart: under
which he had kept the sabbath, if he had remained innocent.
And here it is not unworthy to be observed, that although
the seventh day was not come before his fall, yet the institu-
tion of the sabbath is mentioned before the history of his
fall. 2. After his fall, under a positive law. For when he
had sinned on the sixth day, and the seventh came, he was
not now bound under the bare law of nature to celebrate it;
but according as the condition of Adam was changed, and as
the condition of the sabbath was not a little changed also, a
new and positive law concerning the keeping the sabbath was
superinduced upon him. It will not be unpleasant to pro-
duce a few passages from the Jewish masters of that first

sabbath :—
“Circumcisioan' saith R. J udahr, “ and the sabbath, were
