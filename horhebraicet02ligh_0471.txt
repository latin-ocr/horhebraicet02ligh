They are bound also to the peace offerings of the Chatqzzoah by

“ The Lord saith, ³ Let them not appear before nie e111pty,’
Deut. xvi. 16. That is, ιἿῖἳἺῺ ἶΞἾρ Let him bring art-oblation
qs a barnt sacrifice in his hand when he goes up to the feast.
And those burnt sacrifices are called ΠἾἾΝἾ ,ΠἾῖἸἾῺ bzc-rnt·
sacrifices of appearance, and also ΠἪΝἻ appearance, without
the addition os the word barnt sacrzfice. And the Chaffl'yah:
From thence, because the Lord saith, ‘ Ye shall keep it a
feast to the Lord‚' it means this, &³0th ῙΞἾΡ ΝἾΞἾΠ That ιι
man briny peace affere'nsss, and these peace offerings are called
Ohayiyah.''

ΙΙ. Of these two, namely, the appearance and the Chayigyah,
the Ohayiyah was the greater and more famous. For

First, certain persons were obliged to the Chaqiyah, who
were not obliged to the appearance .· ·'‘ Her that indeed is not
deas, but yet is dumb, is not obliged to appearance‚· but yet
he is obliged Ul'lmvzv to rejoice.” It is true some of the
Gemarists distinguish between ΠἎἼᾸΠ Ohayiyah and ΠΠΌΨ
νε]”<>ἱσίφι95. But one Glosser upon the place alleged WDND ³:
ΠΖΡἎΠ ΓἻ &w ΠΠὩΨΠ :wrm-l that which he saith ⁰f
‘ rey‘oicin9,' obtains also of the ‘ C'hagn'qah! And another saith,
‘⁴ He is bound mmmm& to rejoiciny, namely, to rejoice in the
feast; as it is written, ‘And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast?
And they say elsewhere, that that rejoicing is over the peace-
offerings, namely‚ in eating flesh.''

Secondly, appearance was not tied so strictly to the first
day, but the Ohayiyah was tied to it. mmm 0³57) D'l‘ffiy
