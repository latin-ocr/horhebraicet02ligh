mud, ‘⁶ Thirteen⁰ years Rabbi laboured under the pain of the
teeth,'' &c.); because of which there were some who were
pleased to account him for the Messias ς because, according
to the propheta Messias should be ‘a man of sorrows :⁹ and
yet they look for him coming in pomp.

This allegation of Matthew may seem somewhat unsuitable
and different from the sense of the prophet: for Isaiah
speaks of the Messias carrying our infirmities in himself ;
but Matthew speaks concerning him healing them in others:
Isaiah of the diseases of the soul (see 1 Pet. ii. 24) 3 Matthew
of the diseases of the body. But in this sense both agree
very well, that Christ's business was with our infirmities and
sorrows, and he was able to manage that business: his part
was to carry and bear them, and in him was strength and
power to carry and bear them. In this sense, therefore, is
Matthew to be understood ; he healed the demoniacs and all
diseased persons with his word, that that of Isaiah might be
fulfilled, He it is who is able to bear and carry our sorrows
and sicknesses. And so, whether you apply the words to the
diseases of the mind or the body, a plain sense by an equal
easiness does arise. The sense of Isaiah reacheth indeed
further3 namely, That Messias himself shall be a man of
sorrows, &Q but not excludin g that which we have mentioned,
which Matthew very fitly retains, as excellently well suiting
with his case.

Gergashites‚ or from the word &Dum-l] Garqushta, which
signifies clay or dirt, we leave to the more learned to discuss.
