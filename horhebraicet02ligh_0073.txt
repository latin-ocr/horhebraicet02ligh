baptized into the name of the Messias, that was now inune-
diately to come 3 and into the profession of the doctrine of
the gospel concerning saith and repentance3 that they plunged
themselves into the river, and so came out. And that which
is said of them, that they were baptized by him “ confessing
their sins,'' is to be understood according to the tenour of the
Baptist's preaching3 not that they did this man by man, or
by some auricular confession made to John, or by openly
declaring some particular sins3 but when the doctrine of
John exhorted them to repentance and to saith in the Mes-
sias, they renounced and disowned the doctrine and opinion
of justification by their works, wherewith they had been
beforetime leavened, and acknowledged and confessed them-
selves sinners.

Ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνχν In Jordan] John could not baptize in
any part of Jordan, so it were within the bounds of Judea
(which the evangelists assert), which had not been dried up,
and had afforded a passage to the Israelites when they came
out of Egypt, and were now entering into the promised land.

Ver. 7: Ἰδὼν δὲ πολλοὺς τῶν Φαρισαίων καὶ Σαδδουκαίων·
And seez'ngy many qf the lerisees and Saddawees] To at-
tempt a history of the Pharisees and sadduceos, after so
many very learned men, who have treated of their original,
mannerS, and institutions, would be next to madness: we
will briefly touch at a few things, and those, perhaps, less
obvious¹

1. That the Pharisees do not derive their name (as some
would have it) from the word ΨἾΞ) which signifies to expomzd,
is sufficient-ly evinced by this, that there were women-Phari-
sees, as well as men. R. Joshuab saith, A religious man
foolish, a wicked man crafty, a woman-Phameae, and the
dashing of the Plearz'sees [against the stones]‚ destroy the
world.” Those things are worth observing, which are spoke
by the Babylonian Gemarists on that clause, ΓΊΨἾἾΞ ww&
