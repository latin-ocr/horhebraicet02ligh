We cannot also pass over that, which indeed is worthy to
be remembered: “Anyf one's servant is to be circumcised‚
though he be unwillingg but any one's son is not to be cir-
cumcised, if he be unwilling. R. Jochanan inquired, Behold
a little son3 do you circumcise him by force? Y ea, although
he be as the son of Urcan. R.Hezekiah saith, Behold, a man
finds an infant cast out, and he baptizeth him in the name of
a servant: in the name of a freeman, do you also circumcise
him in the name of a freeman.'’

We have therefore alleged these things the more largely,
not only that you may receive satisfaction concerning the
thing propounded, namely, how it came to pass that the
people flocked, in so universal a concourse, to J ohn's baptism
(because baptism was no strange thing to the Jews); but
that some other things may be observed hence, which afford
some light to certain places of Scripture, and will help to clear
some knotty questions about baptism.

First, You see baptism inseparably joined to the circum-
cision of proselytes. There was, indeed, some little distance
of time; for ‘⁶ theyg were not baptized till the pain of circum-
cision was healed, because water might be injurious to the
wound.'⁷ But certainly baptism ever followed. We acknow-
ledge, indeed, that circumcision was plainly of divine institu-
tion; but by whom baptism, that was inseparable fremit, was
instituted, is doubtful. And yet it is worthy of observation‚
our Saviour rejected circumcision, and retained the appendix
to it: and when all the Gentiles were now to 110 introduced
into the true religion, he preferred this ‘proselytical intro-
ductory' (pardon the expression) unto the sacrament of en-
trance into the gospel.

One might observe the same almost in the eucharist. The
