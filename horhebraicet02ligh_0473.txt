‘⁶ Ye shall kill the passover before the Lord your (jod, be-
tween the eves, and your sheep and oxen on the morrow, in
that very day, in joy of the feast.”

In one 61166661Χ mention is made of 1ἾῖΔῇ ΠΟΞ tlte less
passover; by which if he understands not the passover of the
second month, which is very usually called by them ’ΠΨ UOD
the secondpassover, or the passover of the second month, in-
struct me what he means by it. However this matter is clear
in Moses, that oxen, or the sacrifices offered after the lamb
eaten, are called the ‘ passover,' as well as the lamb itself.

And no wonder, when the lamb was the very least part ol'
the joy, and there were seven feast-days after he was eaten :
and when the lamb was a thing rubbing up the remembrance
of affliction, rather than denoting gladness and making meri-y.
For the unleavened bread was marked out by the holy Scrip-
ture under that very notion‚ and so also the bitter herbs,
which were things that belonged to the lamb. But how much
of the solemnity of the feast is attributed to the ΟΙιαφίραΙι,
and the other sacrifices after that, it would be too much to
mention, since it occurs everywhere.

Hear the author of the Aruclc concerning the C'lmyiyalc
,of Pentecost: “ The word :117 chag] denotes dancing, and
clapping hands for joy. In the Syriae language it is ΝᾸἾΠ
ckiyak: and so in the Scripture ’Ἶῆἲῗζ-ζῧ *mam aniz-Q [Psalm
cvii. 27. The inter-linear version reads, They went in a round,
and moved themselves like a drunken man] : and from this root
it is, because they eat, and drink, and dance [or make holiday.]

And the sacrifice of the 0116ρὶ9αή, which they were bound to
bring on a feastday, is that concerning which the Scripture

saith, Πῆζγῆῑὶζ] 313] ζὶῆζΨἸ and thou skalt make :tri chay, a

solemnity of weelcs to the Lord thy Orod, a free will offering of
thy hand‚''' &c. Deut. xvi. 10.

And now tell me whence received that feast its denomi-
nation, that it should be called 217 tlze feast of wecks? Not
from the offering of the loaves of first fruits, but from the
Ohayiyalz‚ and the feasting on the Okayiyah. The same is
to be said of the feast of the Passover. So that John said
nothing strange to the ears of the Jews, when he said, “ They
