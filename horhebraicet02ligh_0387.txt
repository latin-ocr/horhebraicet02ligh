Oh. xxviii. 19.] Eoeeroitations upon St. Blattlcew. 381

the twelve tribes was a seal and bond of the covenant, Exod.
xxiv. And now tell me, why are not infants capable, in like
manner, of such a sealing? They were capable heretofore of
circumcision3 and our infants have an equal capacity. The
sacrament doth not lose this its end, through the indisposition
of the receiver. Peter and Paul, apostles, were baptized:
their baptism, according to its nature, sealed to them the
truth of God in his promises concerning the washing away of ⁴
sins, &c. And they, from this doctrinal virtue of the sacra-
ment, received confirmation of their faith. So also J udas
and Simon Magus, hypocrites, wicked men, were baptized: -
did not their baptism, according to the nature of it, seal
this doctrine and truth, “that there was a washing away
of sins3” It did not, indeed, sea] the thing itself to them;
nor was it at all a sign to them of the ‘washing away' of
theirs: but baptism doth in itself seal this doctrine. You
will grant that this axiomi is most true, “ Abraham received
the sign of circumcision, the seal of the righteousness of
faith.'' And is not this equally true? Esau, Ahab, Ahaz,
received the sign of circumcision, the seal of the righteous-
ness of faith: is not circumcision the same to all? Did not
circumcision, to whomsoever it was administered, sign and
seal this truth, that there ‘was a righteousness of faithss'
The sacrament hath a sealing virtue in itself, that doth not
depend on the disposition of tlze receiver.

II. Baptism, as a sacrament, is an obligation. But now
infants are capable of being obliged. Heirs are sometimes
obliged by their parents, though they are not yet born: see
also Deut. xxix. 11, 15. For that to which any one is obliged
obtains a right to oblige “ ex aequitate rei,'' from the equity
oftloe thiny, ancl not “ ex captu obligati,'' from the apprehen-
sion qs the person obliqed. The law is imposed upon all under
this penalty, “ Cursed be every one that doth not continue in
all,'’ &c. It is ill arguing from hence, that a man hath power
to perform the law3 but the equity of the thing itself is very
well argued hence. Our duty obligeth us to every thing
which the law commands ; but we cannot perform the least
tittle of it.
